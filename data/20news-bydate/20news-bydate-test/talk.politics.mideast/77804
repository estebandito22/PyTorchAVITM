What is so honorable about placing bombs in passenger airliners,
promising to execute Rushdie, killing 1-2 million people in the
Iran/Iraq war, murdering tourists and persecuting ethinc Christians in
Egypt, massacring Christians in Sudan, harassing Christians in and 
barring Jews from Saudi Arabia?  How are paranoid Muslims "righteous
in defending themsselves" in these situations?  Who are they even
afraid of?

Considering that you seem to be posting from central New Jersey, this
is an odd comment coming from you.  I dare you to speak your mind in
the Middle East in any country besides Israel.
