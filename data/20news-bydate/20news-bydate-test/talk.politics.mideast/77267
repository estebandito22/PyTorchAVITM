Actually I am not sure you have understood what I have said. On several
occasions a minor party has put up an Arab for a Cabinet position. That
is the major party (Labour in this case) has agreed that a minor party
can have so many seats and that party nominates an Arab for one. This is
not acceptable to the major party which insists on the minor party
appointing a Jew. The favours owed, deals done, have all been settled.
What remains is exactly who is going to sit in Cabinet. The party that
gets the seat wants an Arab but that is not acceptable. This *is* racism.
It has nothing to do with politics at all.
