Providing safety and security for one's own people is the most
fundamental responsibility of any political entity. For the Palestinian
leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility, i.e. take the
responsibility to protect their people from radical Palestinian elements
who are opposed to the peace process, is reprehensible. To argue that a
Palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful
political groups only reinforces the reality that the Palestinian
leadership, so far, can not exercise control over radical Palestinian
elements nor effectively deal with the killing of Palestinians by
Palestinians. This is a problem that can only be solved by the
Palestinian people.
