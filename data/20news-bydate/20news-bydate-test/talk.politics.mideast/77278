What a dope!  There is no value for Mohammed Elabdellaoui to be here
at a Western University.  Third-worldist and Islamic brain-rot has
made it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately.

The history of the efforts of the Mufti of Jerusalem to serve the
Nazis in the South Balkans and set up Muslim SS Divisions is
well-documented.  In general, Nazism and the leader-principle
resonated well among Muslim peoples.  Khomeini's concept of the faqih
is a recent example of such resonance.  In fact, totalitarianism is
etymologically a reasonable translation Islam.

To be fair, the Mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of
Muslims to join the SS.  But the rather small Muslim SS unit did
manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size.  There were
also Muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt
of Muslim leaders to entice Muslim people to serve the Nazi cause
actively.  And the Turkish government ignored practically all Nazi
overtures even though an alliance with the Nazis against the Soviet
government would have made a great deal of tactical sense.

Yes, the typical primitive Muslim psychopathological psychotic
behavior upon hearing or reading a disagreeable fact -- start whining
about the Jews.  What a jerk.

You should go back to your mindlessly stupid 3rd world country.  Your
brain has no business in a civilized first world country.
