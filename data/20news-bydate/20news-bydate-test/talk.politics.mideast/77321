It seems that, to keep the peace talks going, Israel has to keep
making goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture, while Palestinian
Arabs continue to go around hunting Jews.

If the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success,
the Arabs are going to have to start reciprocating, especially since
they are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in return
for giving up only intangibles.  If they keep trying to change the
already agreed upon rules, which seems to be one of their favorite
games, the Israelis are not likely to be very confident that the
intangibles they will receive at the bargaining table will be worth
the parchment they're written on.

It takes two to negotiate a peace.  It's time for the Arabs to start
doing their share.
