No, I'm not claiming 2,000,000 have been killed.  We are in the middle of
the genocide process that Mr. Major has given yet another "green light"
to.  Mladic seems to have most of what he wants, but Boban is just
getting his appetite whetted. Because Mladic refuses to allow
international observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centers
in places like Foca, Brcko, and Visegrad, it will be years before we have
an accurate account of the number killed. 

In practical terms, it would be impossible to kill all 2,000,000.  There
just isn't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and
transportation lines that the Nazis took 8 YEARS to develop.  And
remember, the Nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied.  To
actually kill 42% of the population requires extreme genocidal
organization.   

But I do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic
annihilation of Bosnian Muslim culture, by killing as many as is
feasible, by rape, by torture, by the demolition of mosques, libraries,
and culture artificts, the burning and renaming of villages, the shelling
of civilians.  So that there won't be any of the 2,000,000 or so Muslims
whose lives have not been shattered by the genocide, though they still
may be alive.

And Mr. Major not only finds this acceptable, he helps it along by making
sure that the victims don't have arms to defend themselves.
