	Huh?  Mohamed Salimeh was perhaps a Korean?  How do you claim
arab-americans had no involvement in the WTC bombing?

	Ok, his involvement is alleged by the FBI, which doesn't seem
to reliable these days.  But honestly, there is a pile of evidence
pointing to them, and it seems those 5 were involved.

	This does not mean that all arab-americans were involved, nor
should they be blamed for it, but denying that there were some
arab-americans involved sounds sorta silly to me.
