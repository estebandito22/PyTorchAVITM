What?  The ACLU fighting against an anti-hate law?  You mean that the
ACLU would support gay-bashing, racial discrimination and anti-semitic
violence?  Thanks, Andi, for reminding us that the constitution
preserves our rights to such fun activities.

Jews are offended by the Holocaust deniers, too.  The Revisionists,
