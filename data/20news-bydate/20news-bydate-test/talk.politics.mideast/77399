        I don't mean to sound disrespectful, but since the majority
of the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seem
to be muslims, christians and jews, my question could be of some 
interest to any of them.
        It's my impression that both Islam and Christianity pay great
respect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from Judea/Galilee. Why 
they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery
to me (personally, I prefer Woody Allen - his stories are much juicier)
- but perhaps it's an accident of history.
        Anyway, it seems that they may be talking about two different
jews. According to the New Testament his father's name was Joseph,
while in Qur'an he appears as Zachariah.  
        Who's right and why the name difference? I'm really curious.
                David.
