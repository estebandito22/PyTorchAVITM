You are somewhat close to truth. But you shouldn't forget that
nationality is a recent invention of the western europe. In the
days of the Ottoman empire, the religion was the main point of
difference between social classes. The Ottomans didn't recognize
Turks, Arabs, Greeks, Serbs... Just christians, muslims, jews...
So, for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society the
bosnian muslims were "Turks". After all, there aren't many "real" 
(ethnic) Turks living even in Turkey today. Even in Europe, it's
the culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of
one's culture.

Can you support this?
