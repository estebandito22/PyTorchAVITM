Actually, the record of the Allies activities, in the face of
incontrovertible evidence as to what the Nazis (may they rot in hell)
were doing, clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done
nothing.  The railways to the camps were not bombed, despite the ease
of doing so.  The US, the "place of refuge" allowed in a bare pittance
of Jews from Europe, primarily for public relations, so that the
government could say it was "doing something".  Many ships with
refugees were turned away from US shores; some found refuge in Cuba or
South America, many others sunk or had to return to Europe (with
predictable consequences).  The hope today is that we have
collectively learned a lesson, and are less complacent to ignore other
countries' "internal affairs".  The sad reality is that this does not
seem to be the case.
