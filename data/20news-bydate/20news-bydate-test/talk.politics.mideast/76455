There were a great many Germans, Poles and others who did not
sympathize with the victims of the Holocaust but instead participated
with enthusiasm in the killing.

The Holocaust wasn't a massacre, it wasn't even killing for sport; it
was an entire Industry of Death.  German engineers, architects
technicians and bureaucrats proudly put their best efforts into as
efficient and methodical a Killing Machine as they could devise and
operate.  And it certainly was something extraordinary.

Please don't bleat to us about how the Nazis suffered from the
Holocaust.

But what you DID do, when Waldo wrote:
  All Jews suffered during WWII [...]
was "correct" him with:
  All humans suffered [...]

So what WERE you implying?

>Neither was I implying any

Are we supposed to thank you for your generosity?  
Or should we be pleased with your minimal common sense?

Why is it that when someone writes something simple like "All Jews
sufffered during WWII" that YOU feel the burning need to add
commentary?  Regardless of what people write, you keep trying to twist
things into what YOU want to hear.  People with similar tendencies in
more extreme form are sometimes called Historical Revisionists.  Is
this something that you aspire to?
