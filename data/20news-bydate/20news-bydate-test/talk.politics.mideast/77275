"In those Moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched for
 arms by the Armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of such
 search, and not only had many Moslems been killed, but horrible tortures 
 had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as to where
 valuables had been hidden, of which the Armenians were aware of the 
 existence, although they had been unable to find them."

                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks
