When I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, our guide told
us the story of that mosque - not sure if it was true.

Apparently, it was built by a Jewish convert to Islam.  He had
had a dispute with his neighbours, and built the mosque "davka" to
annoy them.  It's a cute story, but not sure if it's true...
