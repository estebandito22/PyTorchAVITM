In Turkish Genocide Apology <9304261739@zuma.UUCP> as scribed by its servile
dolt sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic) we read a response to article <1993Apr26.

[EP] This has been discussed before, by several people, on this net.  The

What a fool! For the above to be true, [which it is not] the WWI Russian
General Dro must have worked from his grave to assist x-Soviet Armenia.
Soviet Armenia became ex-Soviet Armenia in 1991 and Dro died in 1958! Then
Dro would have to travel back in time, while dead, from 1991 to WWII to help
Nazi Germany!
