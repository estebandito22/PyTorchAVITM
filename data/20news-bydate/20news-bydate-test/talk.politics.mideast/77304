Mr. Oguocha,
  "Muslims" in the Bosnian context are in fact "Turks"... In fact, correct
  me if I am wrong, Serbs are attacking Bosnians with their battle cries
  "Death to the Turks!". 

  Is this so shocking? Years of communism apparently suppressed their 
  hatred and anger towards the Turks. But such hatred is obviously one that
  dies hard. 
  
  Serbs must understand, Turks are no longer the good old barbarians world
  has come to know by propaganda after propaganda. 
  
  Serbs must further understand that barbarism does not work. 
  
  Serbs must even further understand that barbarism would one day have
  to face counter-barbarism. So, I urge those people [Serbs] to stop
  killing Bosnian women and children. And they must never forget that
  Turks in the motherland are watching...patiently.
  
 Cordially,
