Since Facts and Myths doesn't even know where Deir Yassin was,
why should we pay any attention to the rest of what it says?

This account from Eric Silver is the only valid point that M&F makes.
You can find it together with other evidence and analysis in 
Silver's biography of Begin.  Also in Silver's book you will find
documentary evidence that nearly everything else in M&F's account
is pure bullshit.

This is pretty disgusting.  The Guardian was told of one or two
feeble old men who dressed in women's clothing in a pathetic 
attempt to escape death.  See Silver's book.
