Yeah!  That's it! :)  You've really outdone yourself this time Nick...
Don't forget the "Davidian Muslims"... :)

Islam is not a race.  It's a religion.  You can be white, black,
Fijian or Alaskan.  I guess you didn't absorb too much of the Malcolm
X interest circulating.  You see, the whole point of Islam is that it
stresses equality amongst all peoples.  Now, I do realize this is
difficult for you to comprehend given your staunch beliefs in Serbian
ethnic cleansing, but give it a try, it's really not that difficult.

That's right, it's a Disneyland war -- all a setup for the TV cameras.
There are also people who believe man never landed on the moon, that
the whole Apollo story was done in TV studios...

Terms of secession?  You are, of course, joking, right Nick?  Nobody
*chose* to fight.  Bosnia and Croatia were *internationally*
recognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their
well-documented genocide.  That makes them an outside aggressor.  It's
a simple genocide, a classical example of ethnic cleansing.  There is
no question of civil war...
