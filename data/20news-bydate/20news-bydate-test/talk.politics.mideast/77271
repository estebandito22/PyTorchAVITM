Josip,

please, don't be offended at this question: Who are the "Muslims" in the
Bosnian context? i know that a moslem/muslim is a believer in Islam. Islam 
is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world. But it is not
, yes definitely not, an ethinic group. ok! so, these Bosnian Muslims, who
are they? to which ethnic group do they belong? what language(s) do they
speak? do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats? 
the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has 
kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was 
changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended!
