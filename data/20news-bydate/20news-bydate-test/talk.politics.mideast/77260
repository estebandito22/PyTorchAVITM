Look nobody asked those countries about their UN forces
to be on the ground.  They can take their forces which are
incomponent and ineffective at the first place.  And let whoever are
willing to do the job what it takes.  How anyone can defend this
stinking UN force on the ground who let the Bosnnian PM
yanked out from the UN vehicle and being shot by the Serbian
military?  How anyone can defend this UN force who are just watching
the shelling on cities and towns everyday?  How anyone can
defend and say those stinking UN forces being effective
when Bosnian had almost 14,000 children casualties between 5-14 age 
groups?  I think talking about the current UN forces to Bosnian
muslims is just an insult to their casualties.   

I think Senator Biden said it all what has to be said on this issue.
Europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this 
world.  Like Biden said, they are the bigots when it comes to 
cultural difference and minorty closer to their home.
Because they get rid of their minorities long long time
ago starting in 15th centuries.  And they let Adolph
to take care of the rest in 20th Century.  But he was much more 
naughty than they expected because he dared to step many 
toes.  So, why spoil the good thing now when Serbs doing today what 
they were thinking the same yesterday.
