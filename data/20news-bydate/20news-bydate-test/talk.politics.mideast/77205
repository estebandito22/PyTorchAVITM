If he gives you the same story explaining the presence of several
synagogues in the "Moslem Quarter", then the story becomes suspect...

In reality, the Old City was not as neighborhooded in the past as it
became after 1948.  In pre-Israel Jerusalem, there were many Jews in
what is now called the Moslem Quarter.  There are postal and telephone
directories from that time to prove it.  It's really rather
interesting to hear Arabs there claim that a house or store has been
in the family for centuries even when there are clear photos and
documents that show a Jewish-owned business at the same location just
a few decades ago.
