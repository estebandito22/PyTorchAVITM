Hello, I've been following discussions on 17" monitors in 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good
reviews.  I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products
as well as some others that may fit the bill.   

I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI.
I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics
board like the Retina, and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically
I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large
(=>17") if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been
very happy with a 16" on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home.

I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi
monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty
good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very
often as are Mag and Viewsonic.

Ok, stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are
the products in their line?  What are the technical specs?  Esp. what
scan freq and max resolutions can they handle?  What's list and street
cost - if avail. from a third party, and where can I get ahold of them? 
Same info for Sony and Hitatchi.

Thank you very much!!
