You can configure devices for the same IRQ as long as you don't use them
*simultaneously*, under Dos at least. Both LPT1: and SB just sit there until
you tell them to do something. You can't configure a SoundBlaster for IRQ7
if you got an Ethernet Card which hits that IRQ a thousand times or so per 
second.
