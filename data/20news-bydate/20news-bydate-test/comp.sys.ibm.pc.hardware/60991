Hi,
  I've seen alot of ads for voicemail/fax/data modems.....this would
be way-cool if they work well....I don't want to have someone call me
and get the connecting sound of a fax machine.  Do they work very well?
Has anyone out there played with one?  If so, please tell me what brand
and other info like that.....
					Thanks,
					Kent
