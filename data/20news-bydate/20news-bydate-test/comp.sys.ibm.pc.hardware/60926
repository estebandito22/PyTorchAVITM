Hi,

  I have bought a new harddisk and want to use it with my old
  TEAC SD3105 , 100Mb harddisk. Unfortunataly I do not have any 
  documentation with this harddisk. Could someone please tell me
  how I should set the jumpers for master or slave ?
		  
				       Thanks in advance,
				       Robert Tenback.
