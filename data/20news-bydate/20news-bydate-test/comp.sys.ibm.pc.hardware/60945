HELP!  I am trying to view .JPG files with my 386SX, 20MHz machine
.  I have a STB-POWERGRAPH graphics card with 1024 X 768 by 256 colors,
with 1Meg RAM on it.

I have tried CVIEW097 (with windows-- EXTREMELY SLOW), and DVPEG24.
DVPEG24 doesn't work!  Even if I pick a lot of the "modes" that are
supported by POWERGRAPH (so it says in the manual), it doesn't work
when I try to view a picture... it only buzzes.

Anyone out there that can help me; give me suggestions?

I would really appreciate it!

Thanks!
