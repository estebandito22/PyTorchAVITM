Why is it going to take a year for V.fast to become a standard? Are there
technical problems to work out, or is it just bureaucratic slowdown? THANKS!

   Do hamsters have a natural habitat anymore (ie: "wild" hamsters)? Or does
their world consists only of a plastic gym that we call their home while they
call it hell? Funny how we like to watch others *sweat while our butts take
root on the sofa.
   *I'm don't think hamsters sweat. I'll go shave one and get back to you.
