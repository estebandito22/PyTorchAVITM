hi,
  just a quick question reguarding pc tape backup. I own a 386 dos box
and have an Archive VP402 interface card connected to a QIC-02 tape
drive. Now the simple question is, does anybody in netland know were I
can get some software for msdos (ver 5.0) to run this setup, freeware
or shareware preferred .

Thanks in advance,
                   Darryl

sorry for the repost but I'm still getting to grips with Pnews.
