I am servicing a machine (HP-286) and whenever the thing starts up I get
4 beeps on powerup.  Does anyone know what error message that signifies?  I 
don't seem to have any problem with the machine but the lady who is using it
is "very concerned" about it.  

Don't you just love HP computers???

Preferr responses by E-mail but I read the net so you can post it here.
