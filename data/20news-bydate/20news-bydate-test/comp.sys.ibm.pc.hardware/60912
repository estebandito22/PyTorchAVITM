hello,

for 2 months I've unsuccessfully attempted to get either
a 3rd or 4th serial port working on my system.

various systems diagnostics (e.g., MSD, Norton) tell me
it's there, but anything I hook up to it can't use it

I have two serial ports on the motherboard

if I set my internal FAX/modem for com4 the utility
programs report a COM3

I've checked to make sure all the IRQs and addresses are
correctly (as listed in most manuals) set

am I missing something very basic?

where should I go from here?

any help, even a point in the right direction, would be
most appreciated.
