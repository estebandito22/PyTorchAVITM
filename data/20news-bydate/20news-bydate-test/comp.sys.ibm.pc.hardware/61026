Hi,

I bought, on the net here, a mini-tower 386dx25 system.  It works fine, but
I have no docs on the motherboard.

Does anyone know who a manufacturer named WPI is?  That is the only marking
on the board that is not related to a chip/connector name.  It says
(c)1991, WPI

Also, this board has a connector at the other end of the motherboard, it looks
like this:


  +---------------------------------+
  |  Batt                           |
  |                        387      |  Socket for 387 math coprocessor
  |                                 |
  |                     386         |  386 chip is about here
  |                                 |
  | ========= ====                J |  = signs are the ISA slots
  | ========= ====                M |
  | =========                     P |  Jumpers for turbo/kb etc are where
  | ========= ====         ------ E |  marked
  | ========= ====         ------ R |
  | ========= ====         ------ S |  - signs are 8 banks of SIMM sockets
  | ========= ====                  |
  | =========          ==== ======= |  <<<These connectors are the mystery
  +---------------------------------+     connectors!!!!
                       ^^^^ ^^^^^^^
                       What is this connector?

Is this a place to plug an extra memory board in?  I've seen thatr mentioned
in some motherboard docs.  Some allow an 8-meg card and 8 meg in simms.  Is
this what it is for?

Phil
