Can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal
width hides out on the Tseng Labs ET4000 with a 15/16/24 bit dac?
I am trying to use the 640x480x16M mode under unix (so i cant just call int 10h)I have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but I
am not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et4000.
Anyway, the problem is that in this mode, the Horizontal Total Register
(3d4h index0) is apparently set to 0x27, but 3d4h index 1 (the displayed clocks)
is set to 0xEF, so 0x27 is nonsense. A resonable value would be 0x0127 - so is
there a high bit, and if so, where is it?
Also, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and
what would be an appropriate frequency?). The documentation isn't really very
clear (tseng.txt from  vgadoc2.zip from some ftp site) about this.
My card is a MegaVga/1024 1Mb card. Seems to have a Tseng Labs Bios (ver 8.05 I
think.) Works nicely under dos, and very well under unix (linux) in all the
non-hicolor modes. Great for running X-windows in up to 1152x900x256ni - if your
monitor will take it (only just in my case).

Please email the answer, as I can't read news very often.

Thanks very much,
