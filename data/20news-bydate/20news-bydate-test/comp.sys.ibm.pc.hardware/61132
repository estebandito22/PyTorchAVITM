Subject:    Need specs for a Western Digital IDE HD
Lines: 9

A friend of mine needs spec for a used hard drive he just got:
It is a Western Digital, IDE, 340 meg
with 1010 cylinders and 12 heads.  We believe the model number is
wd2340A, but we can't be sure.  It is a 12 ms, 3.5" model.

Any info would be appreciated, either from somone who knows, or maybe
western digitals phone number

Thanks
