I am asked to design a video-aid system for teacher to show their students
how to work their way round in Windows.

I have seen people using video projector, TV set and large size monitor as
thrir display for presentations. I am told that there are three ways to
connect to a video projector: composite, Y/C & RGB.

Can anyone explain to me the different between the three and the likely cost
for each of them?

I would also like to know if there are TELNET or KERMIT for Windows.

Please reply to me via E-amil as well as bulletin. My internet account is
