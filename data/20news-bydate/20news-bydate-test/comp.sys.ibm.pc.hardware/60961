Due to some problems with my IDE drive, I LL formatted the Maxitor7213AT.
Now it started to give me some errors in some applications. I was told
Maxitor has a utility called IDE_INT in their BBS, anyone tried it? Can
some one tell me what that BBS number is? Or better, can I find the file
in some ftp site? Or perhaps someone can email it to me? Thanks.
