I have an old IBM PC-XT motherboard which has TWO banks
of dip switches (eight switches per bank).  I need to 
know which switch is required to install a hard disk.

Does anyone have any archived documentation that would
help me?  
                                            
Thanks -jim-  jimd@cae.prds.cdx.mot.com
