The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple 
and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an "idle" temp - not doing lots of
bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  This
is in a Micron computer, without heatsink.

I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but I might take the fan off.  It
makes a horrible whine at times, and I wonder what the vibration is doing to
the pins on the cpu etc...
