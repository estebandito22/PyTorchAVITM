	I am wondering if anyone has any opinions about the 2theMAX 4000S
SVGA card.  I just purchased one due to a great price on it.  It boasts 16.7
million "true" colors, with 1MB onboard.  If you know anything about this 
card, please respond via mail, as this group tends to be overwhelming at
times with posts.  Thanks in advance!!!
