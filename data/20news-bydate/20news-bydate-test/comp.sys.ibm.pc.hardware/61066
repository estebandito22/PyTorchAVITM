Doesn't anybody actually read the licence agreement of WinBench
before blindly running it? The licence agreement very clearly says
that details about hardware configuration, driver, resolution and
other relevant facts *MUST* be included when giving WinMark results.

Ziff-Davis wants everybody to do this and that requirement makes
sense, really! Plain numbers are useless when resolution, driver and
machine are unknown.
