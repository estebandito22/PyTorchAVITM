This isn't at all too high of a price.  Keep in mind that you get *8* meg of 
ram, a *local bus* IDE *and* SVGA card,  a *250* mb hd, and a *15"* 
monitor.  The local bus IDE and SVGA really kick butt in Windows.  I have 
used a couple of machines with VLB in the past, and all I can do is praise 
Gateway.
