Seeing all these questions about uart types, their availability, and their
relative merits, wouldn't it be fine, if for internal highspeed modems there
were a mode of operation bypassing the dull and stupid uart interface and
instead accessing directly the relatively large send/receive buffers of the  
modem, thus eliminating all problems with interrupt latencies ?
Just an idea,
