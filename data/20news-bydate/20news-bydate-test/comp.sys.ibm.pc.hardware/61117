I purchased one personal computer and three for business from them. No 
problems. The only time I called tech support was for a minor question 
about a video driver and I had no problem getting through.

All four machines seem to be high quality and well made.  A 486dx50 EISA 
machine has been our network file server running 24 hrs per day since last 
summer with no problems.

I hope this is helpful.
