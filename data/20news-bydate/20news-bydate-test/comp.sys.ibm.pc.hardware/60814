We are doing a research about a passive dynamic vision guided
vehicle.
Completed the first theoric part, we have to make the effective
realization of this vehicle.

We need the necessary hardware for image acquisition from a videocamera
and for their subsequent elaboration (tipically: edge detection).

We ask for informations about available products in the market for
this purpose (in real time, 20-25 frames/second).
Hence we need frame-grabber cards and/or DSP cards for SUN or PC platform. 

We are also very interested in receiving comments and suggestions from users
of these cards, especially about programming tools.

Furthermore we are looking for the same kind of informations about
digital controlled Pan&Tilt devices.

Thanks in advance

Best regards
