I have an 8-bit serial card with two ports.  Each port has the option of
using IRQ 2,3,4 or 5.  I also have two serial ports on a multi-I/O card,
and the ports can be set to IRQ 3,4,5,7 or 9.  From other posts I've read,
I get the impression that IRQ2 on the 8-bit card is the same as IRQ9 on
the multi-I/O card.  Am I right?
