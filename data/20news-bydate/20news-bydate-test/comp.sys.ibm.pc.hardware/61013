With your date/time problems, you MIGHT have a problem with the Dallas
Clock Chip (I'm making a possibly bad assumption that your system has
a clock chip and that it's the standard Dallas Clock Chip).  I always
look at the battery and the clock chip when such things go wrong--
at least, as the first course of action.
