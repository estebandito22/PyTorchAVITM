greetings..
I'm a novice in messing comp. hardware.
My original IDE HD is a 42MB Western Digital which came with the system
when I bought it. And I just got a 213MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to
add as a slave drive. I did change the jumper settings on 213A Maxtor to
configure it as slave drv, but I didn't change anything on my 42M Western
Dig, since I didn't have any doc. on it. And as I predicted, It just beeped
and gave me an error message about HDD controller.
So, I had to take my 42M off & install my 213A to be my only HD.
 
any help on this matter would be much appreciated.
(before I trashed my 42MB)
 
Thankx much
