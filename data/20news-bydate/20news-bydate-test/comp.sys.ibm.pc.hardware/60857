I know you work at sun, but that's really no reason not to like fast 
computers. I suspect a conspiracy here. Are you trying to drag Intel through 
the mud at a con or something? I really wish you guys would make your own 
computers faster instead of degrading others'. Why don't you go straight for 
the top and run a pentium at 0.7 MHz while you're at it?

Seriously though; Why in the bleeding hell do you want a 386/40 to run at 
25MHz?????????????
