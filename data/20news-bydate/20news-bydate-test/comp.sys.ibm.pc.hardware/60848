Subject: Need help/info on Hard Drive terms

Hi all.

I've been installing a new hard drive recently and have run into several
terms that I'm not sure about.

1.) Hard Sectored/Soft Sectored -- What's the difference?  How do I know
which to use?

2.) Head Skew & Cylinder Skew -- I understand that these are related to
performance... How do I know what's optimal?

My drive is an ESDI drive, if that makes a difference in discussing
these terms.

		Any info/help is greatly appreciated!
