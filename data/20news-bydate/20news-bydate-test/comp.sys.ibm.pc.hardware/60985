I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday, and installed it into my Gateway
DX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5
(the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how
should I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation
program recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to
IRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right now
I have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this "cascade to
IRQ8-15" business?  

A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that 
only DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about
32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus
extension to do 32-bit DMA?

Yet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hang
the machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode??
Civilization however works fine ( at least so far). Any body knows what I might
have done wrong? 

Thanks (I am obviously a newbie) -- John
