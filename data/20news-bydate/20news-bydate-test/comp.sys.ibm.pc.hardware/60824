To all netters,

  In my last post that concerning about the CYRIX 486DLC CPU, I said the
benchmark program COMPTEST stated there is a bug in CYRIX CPUs. This is NOT
true and I must apologize to the author of COMPTEST. The actual program
that gives this report is F-PROT 2.07, a virus detection and removal
program. The report stated there is a bug in the Cx486SLC but not DLC.
Sorry, sorry, sorry...
