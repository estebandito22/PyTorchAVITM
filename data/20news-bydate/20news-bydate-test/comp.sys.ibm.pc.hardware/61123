My disk that had my joystick code that some of you were kind enough to mail
me puked....specifically, I am looking for C code to read the position
of joystick WITHOUT using int15h, i.e. accessing port 0x200/0x201 directly.

I need it in C becaues of memory model considerations.

I only need to be able to read the X and Y position also.
