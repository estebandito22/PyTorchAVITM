  close. Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter.

   Even if you are running DOS, if your CPU can't handle the speed of the
interrupts, you will still lose characters.  I have one 286/10 machine with
an external 9600 bps modem attached and can't drive the serial port any faster 
than 19.2k without losing characters.
