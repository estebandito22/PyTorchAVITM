 I am think of buying a new computer through the mail order, I am looking at
the Gateway 2000 66V systen and the Zeos's system. Which is better (in terms of
value, price, ungrade, service), because I am in canada, I wonder can i have
the same level of service as in the states? 

Thank you for any advice!
