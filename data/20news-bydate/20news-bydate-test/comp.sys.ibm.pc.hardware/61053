Perry> Perhaps you should try nic.funet.fi instead of funet.fi ??!?!?

Another possibility is, that you did not give your email address as password
for the anonymous account. If you that, you see following message:

230-
230-You entered an invalid/inpropable password, and are now accessing
230-restricted subset of files.    Please read README for more information.
230-We have special access features, see file README

This can happen, if your terminal emulator does not generate the '@'
character as you think (it is hard to see, since passwords are not echoed..).
