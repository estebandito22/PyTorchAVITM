   I have a 386DX clone, with a DTC ESDI controller and Toshiba 660
mbyte
drive. Since installing DOS 6.0, when I tried to re-install software
from
5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disks, when I mount the second..third..fourth disks, DOS
6
doesn't recognize that I have changed floppies. If I do a "DIR", I see
the
contents of the previous diskette. The only way to get DOS to recognize
that
diskettes have changed, is to do a "label", and then to not label them.

   Buying DOS 6.0 has been a colossal mistake. DOS 5.0 was stable, and
worked
well with my equipment. I have Superstor Pro, and DESQVIEW/X ( with
QEMM, 
Manifest, etc), so there aren't any features of DOS 6 that I am using. I
guess
I should roll back to DOS 5.0 but I am wary of what will happen when I
do it.

   Besides, like a fool, I don't have a DOS 5. bootable disk anymore.
I've
made the same mistakes I caution my users not to make. Like sheep, I
joined 
the crowd flocking to DOS 6. Baaa Baaad system administrator.
