Netters!

I have seen some postings on PC/IP from MIT. This package out of 1986(?)
should be a full TCP/IP fro the DOS-machines. Is there anyone out there
that's using it?

I want to connect a DOS-machine to my OS/2 machine... Tell me what the
DOS-machine should run (sample CONFIG and AUTOEXEC would be great) and
where I can find a nfs client. I understand that a telnet and a ftp
client are part of the package.

I've got the Crynwr package drivers, but that's it! Please point me to
a good source of information if you cannot help me yourself...

regards, JV
