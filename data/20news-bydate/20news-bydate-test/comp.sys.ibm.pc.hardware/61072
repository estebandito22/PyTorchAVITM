For the past week or so I've been trying to install a QIC-36 tape drive
and an everex 8bit full size controller in my 486dx50 EISA system with no
luck. I end up getting an error (miscompare) during the streaming read
part of the test. I am pretty certain that the port setting, irq & dma are
set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind,
retension, write and erase, I also booted the system clean and still the
same proble so I also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts. It has been
suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it down.
My system has an AMI BIOS and I don't have the advanced chip setting
option that I have seen on other systems so I cant do this. Am I going to
have to accept that this set up won't work? or can anyone suggest a work
around? I will be glad to hear your advice/suggestions.
Tony
