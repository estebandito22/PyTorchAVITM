Hello,
a friend a mine has a commodore 386sx and we've put in that machine
a second harddisk, he now has 100+200 MB. But the problem is that
the 200MB harddisk isn't supported in the bios. Alas there's no user type
47 in the setup. At the moment we use it as a 193MB type but there are
getting bad blocks on the harddisk :-<. Question: who knows a solution to this?
I've seen a small program for this once in the BYTE, but I haven't been able
to find this. Would speedstor or diskmanager work for this, I used these
programs quite a lot in the XT-days, but I don't have these anymore, Seagate
used to ship diskmanager with each drive they sold.
 
Help will be greatly appreciated.
