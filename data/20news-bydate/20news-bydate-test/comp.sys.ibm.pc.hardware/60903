I must say that I have been a customer of Midwest Micro for over 4
years now, and have been well taken care of on each purchase.
I have had many friends that have bought that same modem and (THEY)
do have some experience with setting up modems, so there have been
no problems in 6 of them that I know of. The fact that your time
to valuable for you to spend on the modem is where you went wrong.
WHY you say because I must tell you of the 12 yes I say 12 PPI modems
that I have had in the past that I was trying to use on my bbs. They
all were junk and were replace 3 times each, to ther point that
I just said forget it and I wanted my money back. PPI's teck even
said that they didn't even repair them. That they just strip the
parts that are good and junk thr rest of the modem.
I think it was more your fault than Midwest Mirco's faulkt...Sam
