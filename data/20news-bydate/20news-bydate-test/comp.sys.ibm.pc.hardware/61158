I have a Standard Computer 486DX2/66mhz EISA Tower with 16MB RAM, a Quantum 240MB Hard Drive, 1.2 and 1.44 MB floppies and a Colorado 250MB tape drive. I also have a Sound Blaster Pro and a 3COM Ethernet card (3C507) installed. The machine is completely stable in non-Turbo mode. In Turbo mode, Windows for Workgroups crashes or won't come up at all. If Windows does come up, I get General Protection Faults and Divide by Zero System Errors. Is there a problem with memory keeping up with the speed of the CPU o



n these machines?

I have tried to reach Standard Computers, but their phones have been disconnected.
Does anyone know what happened to this company?

I'd prefer e-mailed responses as I don't get to read this newsgroup often.
