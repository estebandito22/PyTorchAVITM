I am very serious about the purchase of a 486dx-33 that uses the Orchid VLB 
mother board, The system also has the VLB IDE and Fahrenheit video board in 
it. I haven't seen or heard ANY bad comments about this board! Does anyone 
out there have any comments good or bad about this board? I am considering 
this board primarily because of Orchid's reputation and long standing in 
the field. Thanks for any and all comments.
