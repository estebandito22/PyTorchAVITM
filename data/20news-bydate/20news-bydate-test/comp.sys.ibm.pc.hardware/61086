Subject: HELP:IDE Drive installation problems
Date: Thu Apr 22 12:11:58 1993

I'm having trouble with installing a second IDE drive on a Promise IDE caching
controller. The first drive is a conner 3204 and works fine. The second drive
is a conner 30174, it is currently unjumpered  to be the slave drive. The
problem is the slave drive is recognized but is reported back as having no
free space. Disabling cache has made no effect. What else should I check for?

Krispy,
Lets start with what Promise controller that you have. Ther are only
about 4 or 6 of them made. The one that I have the DC-99m needs
nothing done but install it as stated. As to the 2th. hd you do know
about running FDISK on it and partisitions and then formatting it
after your finished with the fdisk operation right!....Sam
