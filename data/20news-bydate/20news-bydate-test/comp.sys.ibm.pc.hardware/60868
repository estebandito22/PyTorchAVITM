I am considering adding to my 386 system equipped with a 130meg Maxtor 
HD, a second Maxtor 245 Meg HD.  I assume this will not be a problem. 
However, I remember reading somewhere that to do this, you needed to 
reformat your original drive ?  Is this true ?  If so why ?  My drive is 
full and I really don't like the idea of to re-installing everything 
from floppy!!

    Please E-mail me, or post to the group
