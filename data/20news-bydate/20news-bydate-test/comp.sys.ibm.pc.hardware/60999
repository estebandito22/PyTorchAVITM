Does anyone know if there are any problems (or if it's possible)
adding a third hard drive(scsi) to a dos pc.

I currently have a 386 pc with  Future Domain scsi board  and  2
Maxtor  scsi  drives  installed.  They work great, I haven't had
any problems!

Well, now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another
(larger)  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all I had to do was add it
to the chain(50pin ribbon  that  has  3  connectors)   and   run
the   fdisk   program   to format/initialize the disk.

That didn't happen.  When the pc boots, the  scsi  prom   shoots
back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the board[target
0/target1/target2].  All three disks are seen.

When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk, I choose to
select another  disk(option  5(dos6)) and voila, it's not there.
The first two disks show up no problem, but the  third  disk  is
no-where to be found....



ARGH!

Ideas anyone?????

Thanks in advance!
