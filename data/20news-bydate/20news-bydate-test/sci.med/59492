Hi all,

My skin is very dry in general. But the most serious part is located
from knees down. The skin there looks like segmented. The segmentation
actually happens beneath the skin. I would like to know if there is any
cure for this.

At the supermarkets or pharmacies, there are quite a lot of stuffs for
dry skins, but what to chose?

Thanks in advance for all advices and hints.
