I am quite near sighted.

I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal
holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my
left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the
laser was used to "weld" this back in place as well.

My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional
flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the
treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often
- several each hour.

The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the
vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He
says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own
accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment.

I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.
The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations
so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most
interest to me:

If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course
of action?

If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is
the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect
afterwards.

Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment
maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

Many thanks

Bill
