Resinfo (research and information) is currently seeking contact
_IN_ the United Kingdom with researchers of 'phenylanine', or is
this amino acid uninspiring?

Resinfo is not a regular subscriber to sci.med due to the 
excessive load of data and regrettably, our limited ability
to monitor. It would therefore be appreciated if replies
could be sent direct to;
resinfo@resinfo.demon.co.uk
