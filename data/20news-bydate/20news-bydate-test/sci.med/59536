I just got back from the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting,
where the consensus was that sumatriptan (Imitrex) has no advantages
over DHE-45 nasal spray, which is much less expensive, has fewer side
effects, is as effective, and works more quickly (5-10 minutes vs. 30).
Besides, who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasal
spray works?  DHE nasal spray is not widely available yet -- it has to
be mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country -- but most
neurologists now know about it and know how to order it.
