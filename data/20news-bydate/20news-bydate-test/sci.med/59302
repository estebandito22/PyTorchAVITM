Greg:  Flame definitely intended here.  Bill was making fun of the misspelling. 
Go look up the word "krill."  Also, the correct spelling is Kirlian.  It
involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
subject to a high-voltage source, not of some "aura."  It works equally well
with inanimate objects.

Disclaimer:  Hey, I understand VAXen and VMS.  That's what I get paid for.  My
understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level (or below).  So
unless what I'm saying is directly related to VAX/VMS, don't hold me or my
organization responsible for it.  If it IS related to VAX/VMS, you can try to
hold me responsible for it, but my organization had nothing to do with it.
