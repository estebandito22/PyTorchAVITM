I got this recipe from a watier on the greek island of samos.
They use it as a spread for bread there butit is excellent on
gyro's as well. By the way, the actual name is tzatziki.
Here is the recipe:

yoghurt, chopped garlic, peeled chopped cucumber, salt, white
pepper, a little olive oil and a little vinegar.

I would love to hear of any other good greek recipes out there.
