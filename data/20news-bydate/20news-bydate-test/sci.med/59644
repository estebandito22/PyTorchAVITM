I have been struck down this past week by a stomach bug and fever
which went away quickly when treated with an antibiotic. The
pharmacist told me the antibiotic is effective against a wide
variety of "gram-negative bacteria." I was wondering where I
might have acquired such a bacteria. Could they hang out in swimming-
pool water, or would the chlorine kill them? 

Feeling better, I am
