I need information on the medical (including emotional :-) pros and
cons of circumcision (at birth).  I am especially interested in
references to studies that indicate disadvantages or refute studies
that indicate advantages.  A friend who is a medical student is
writing a survey paper, and apparently the studies she has run into
are all for circumcision, the main argument being a lower risk of
penile cancer.

Please email responses as I am not a frequent reader of either group.
I will summarize to the net.
