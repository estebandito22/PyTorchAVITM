You probably were trying to be facetious but just for the record partial nasal
obstruction is correlated with a number of chronic disorders such as migraine,
hyperthyroidism, asthma, peptic ulcer, dysmenorrhea, and lack of libido (:-) )
[Riga IN. Rev d'Oto-Neuro-Ophthalmol 1957;24:325-335], cardiac symptoms
[Jackson RT. Annals of Otology 1976;85:65-70  Cvetnic MH, Cvetnic V. Rhinology
1980;18:47-50     Cottle MH. Rhinology 1980;18:67-81], and fever, inadequate
oral intake and electrolyte imbalance [Fairbanks DNF. Otorhinolaryngology Head
and Neck Surgery 1986;94:412-415).

So before you post your inane comments it would be nice if you'd run a MEDLINE
search on the topic say back to 1966. There's been extensive literature on this
for over a 100 years.

I may be in cardiology but I've had a very good working relationship with
my colleagues from ENT.
