My (then) wife used to get recurrent yeast infections. One day, her
doctor sent her home with medication for her and a pill for me. I took
the pill, upon her insistence, and was very relieved the next day when I
looked it up in the PDR. It only RARELY causes testicular atrophy...

Anyway, men apparently do get yeast infections.
