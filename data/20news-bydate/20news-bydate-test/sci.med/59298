Greg,
No flame intended, but I think you just missed one of the rare attempts of
humor in sci.skeptic.
"Krillean" against "Kirilian". Get it?
;-)

BTW, I think you're a bit of base yourself, since, to my knowledge, the
electromagnetic field around a stone is rather abscent. But still, a stone
has a nice "aura" on the Kirilian photographs.

Don't remember excactly, but "corona discharge" I think is a more fitting
expression than aura. Think you'll find something on this in the skeptic-faq.


Cheers,
	Jostein
