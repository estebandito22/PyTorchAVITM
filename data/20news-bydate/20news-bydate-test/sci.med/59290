 Speaking from experience, one doesn't need drugs to become disoriented
during hospital stays. I was in hosp for 5 days in late Jan; what with
general noise at all hours of night, staff coming every time I turned over,
or whatever, to check me out, I didn't get much sustained sleep at night.
Spent days groggy & dozing, and all it was from my perspective was that I
was TIRED!
