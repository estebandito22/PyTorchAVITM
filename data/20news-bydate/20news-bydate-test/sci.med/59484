Depression can also have various chemical (environmental) components.
I noticed that I became depressed in various buildings, and at home
when the air conditioning was on. Subsequent testing revealed that
I was allergic to stemphyllium, a mold commonly found in air conditioners.
After I began taking antigens, that problem disappeared.
