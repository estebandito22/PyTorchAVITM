: Thanks,

I have a receipe at home that was posted to me by one of our fellow
netters about a month ago.  I am recalling this from memory but
I think I'm fairly close (by the way it was GREAT!)

1 	pint of plain yogurt 
1/2	med. sized cucumber finely shredded
3	cloves of garlic (more or less by taste)
1/4 tsp	dill weed

The yogurt is dumped into a strainer lined with a coffee
filter and allowed to drain at least 2 hours (you can
adjust the consistancy of the sauce by increasing this time
up to 24 hours)

The shredded cuc is drained the same way

Mix it all together and let it steep for at least
2 hours (it's better the next day) and enjoy!

Steve
