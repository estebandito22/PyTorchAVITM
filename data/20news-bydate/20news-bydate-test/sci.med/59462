We know that sermon.  It is posted roughly every month or so by different
persons, and that doesn't make it any better.

How did you get the idea that skeptics are closed-minded?  Why don't you
consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the
proper methods?  Besides, one can come to a conclusion without closing
one's mind to other possibilities.

I you don't agree with a person, please ask him why he thinks like that,
instead of insulting him.  Perhaps he's right.  Follow your own advice,
be open-minded.

If you don't post a bit of evidence for your claims, I'll complain that
it's always those "neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever" types who 
narrow-mindedly judge others without knowing their motives.
