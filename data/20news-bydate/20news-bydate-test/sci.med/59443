I need some information on the implications of receiving
cortisone shots for a seasonal allergic condition.  

I've had the usual "skin prick" tests for the
common allergies, but reacted to none of the substances.
So for the last two seasons I've received cortisone shots
but the doctors seem reluctant to give more than two or
three shots.  Why?  What are the dangers?
