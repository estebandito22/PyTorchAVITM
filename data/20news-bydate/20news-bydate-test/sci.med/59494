I recently heard of some testing of a new migraine drug called sumatripton
(I have no idea of the actual spelling) that supposedly utilizes a chemical
that trips neuro-transmitters.  My mother has regular migraines and nothing
seems to help - does anyone know anything about this new drug?  Is it in
a testing phaze or anywhere near approval?  Does it seem to be working?

Any information would help.

Please feel free to e-mail rather than take up bandwidth if you prefer.

Thanks in advance,

-Rox
