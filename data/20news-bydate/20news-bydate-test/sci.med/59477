Greeting

I am starting work on a project where I am trying to make strain gages
bond to bone in vivo or a period of several months.  I am currently
using hydroxyapaptite back gages, and I have tried M-bonding the gages
to the bone.  Apart from those two application methods there doesn't
seem to be much else in the literature.  I have only an engineering 
background not medical or biological.  I would be interest in any
ideas about how to stimulte bone growth on the surface of cortical bone.

Thanks for oyur help in Advance.
