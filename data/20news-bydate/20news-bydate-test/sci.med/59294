Hmm.  This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack
therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed
laetrile (whether licensed or not) as a quack.  There are unethical
behaviors (such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees)
which I would not lable as quackish, but prescribing known ineffective
therapies seems to me to be one of the hallmarks of a quack.
