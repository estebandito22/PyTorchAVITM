We need following data for human aorta:

  Tear and shear stress for aorta.
  A plot of the aortic cross-sectional area.  
  Stroke-volume at the aortic root.
  Approximate distribution of blood through the major arterial
      branches of the aorta.
  Flow velocity of blood in aorta.
  
We have various values for flow velocity, If you have any data remember to
give us the references too include in our report
