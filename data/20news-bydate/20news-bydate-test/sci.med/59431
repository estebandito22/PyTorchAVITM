We're about to have our first baby, and have a few questions that we
dont seem to be able to get answered to our satisfaction. 

Reguarding having a baby boy circumsized, what are the medical pros
and cons?  All we've heard is 'its up to the parents'.

How about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water?  We've heard 
stories of infection, etc.  How about after the water has broken?
