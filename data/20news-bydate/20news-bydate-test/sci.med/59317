Am looking for network access to recent research into treatments for
precocious puberty.  If you know of specifics, would appreciate email. 
I have plenty of general textbook type references.  Have a niece whose
daughter is afflicted.  The mother is an RN and has done a rather
exhaustive search of printed material. 

Pls Email suggestions to 
lumensa@lub001.lamar.edu

Thanx.
