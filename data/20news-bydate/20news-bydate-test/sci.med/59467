	Millipedes, I understand, are vegetarian, and therefore almost
certainly will not bite and are not poisonous. Centipedes are
carnivorous, and although I don't have any absolute knowledge on this, I
would tend to think that you're in no danger from anything but a
concerted assault by several million of them.
