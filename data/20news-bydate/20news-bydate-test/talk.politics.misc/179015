What ozone hole in the northern hemisphere?

What exactly will happen if we get an ozone hole in the upper atmosphere?
According to the senior chicken-little at NASA, as much more UV radiation
as if one moved 100 miles south.  Certainly not the calamity that is being
imagined by eco-lunatics.  

CO2 is going up.  So what.  There's no evidence that the increase is
due to burning fossil fuels, no evidence that increasing CO2 will increase
temperatures, and no evidience that raising temperatures will do anything
but good--ie make millions of acres of tundra into productive life-bearing
land.
