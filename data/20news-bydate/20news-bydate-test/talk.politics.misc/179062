Oh, please, enlighten us all. What articles in particular are you
quoting from? I'm doing my Masters in Psychopathology and it would
interest me greatly in seeing these articles that you know exist
(yet I know nothing about). I'm sure I could give them to people
doing their PhD's. With information like this, they'll have their
degree in no time.  (sprinkle sarcasm where applicable)

Don't bother with the little-girl-is-raped-by-her-daddy-and-is-now-
a-lesbian-because-of-it studies. They have always been under critical 
scrutiny as to their validity. (Correlation != causation).
