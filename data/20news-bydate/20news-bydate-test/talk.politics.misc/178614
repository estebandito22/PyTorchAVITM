   A person sees the front of their home is strewn with garbage. That
person removes the trash, and sweeps the sidewalk. His next door neigh-
bors have not. The person then approaches his two neighbors and talks
to them about cleaning the front of their homes, and why it would be
good for their own living conditions, and that of the neighborhood.
   There's nothing wrong with holding your neighbors accountable for
their actions. That is the basis for a viable, safe community.
