      Frankly, I'm sick of being lied to.  It was bad before Clinton,
      and now it's worse.  Here, listen to Ricks' ( FBI ) words,
      ONE-HALF hour before the fire:

       " Come out with your hands up.  This matter is NOW OVER. "

      Now, I hear Ricks ( and REno ) claiming that this was just 
      "another incremental step in pressure".  More bullshit.

      Why did they pick 6 AM  Monday morning?  So nobody would
      NOTICE.  So everyone would be busy at work, starting a new
      week.  More bullshit.

      Did the FBI hold back fire engines?  Here, let me paraphrase
      Sessions"

       " no, we didn't hold back the engines.  We had them on 
         stand-by, blah, balh, blah...   And so, to protect the
         the fireman, we didn't allow the engines to enter until
         it was safe "

     WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?   " YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS? "

     What the HELL kind of double-talk is this?  No, we didn't, so
     blah, balh, we did.    Huh?

     I WATCHED this.

     Clinton takes responsibility, "EVEN THOUGH" it wasn't his 
     decision.  MOre BULLSHIT.  Does he, or does he NOT, take
     responsibility?!   No more "even though" bullshit.  Yes.
     Or no.  

     Christ.
