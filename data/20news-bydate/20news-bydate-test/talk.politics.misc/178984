	Oh they'll get it back, with exposed film. :(

	Shortly after the Rodney King episode, a woman here in Dayton used a
camcorder to tape the police arresting several youths.

	Upon noticing her, the police arrested her (for jaywalking!) and
"accidently" erased the tape while they had it.

	Yep, they'll get their film back allright....
