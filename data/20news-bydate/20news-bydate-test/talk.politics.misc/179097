Doesn't seem like those responsible for the assault were very concerned
about the welfare of the children inside.  Seems like they were more
interested in flexing their muscle before the media.  My reasoning?
Just ask yourself this one question:

Suppose the scenario was slightly different and we had Chelsea Clinton
being kidnapped by terrorists, holed up in a compound for 51 days.
Do you think Clinton, Reno, the FBI, and the ATF would be so eager
to use a show of force?

Nuff said.
