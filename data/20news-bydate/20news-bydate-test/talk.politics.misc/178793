Say WHAT?  Surrounding the compound with armed men and throwing
grenades isn't a provocation?

You're smoking something not legal in the US.  They never rang the
doorbell.  Not even the BATF has claimed that they have. This was a
no-knock search.

As to the good reason the BATF has-- the warrant and supporting
affadavit have not been made public.

Just say NO to police searches and seizures.  Make them use force.
