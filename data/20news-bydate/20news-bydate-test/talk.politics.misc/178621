You are forced everyday to associate with people that you do not
wish to, and there isn't even a law that makes you do it.  But 
you do, becuase you want to go shopping, or go to work, or go to
a public park, or go to a baseball game, etc.

The process of ending discrimination is based upon the rational
concept 'that all men (women, people) are created equal', have
the same equal standing and chances in society.
