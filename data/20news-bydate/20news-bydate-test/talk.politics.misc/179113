Hatemonger: someone who reminds people of why homosexuals are dying
in such large quantities of AIDS -- because their sexual compulsions
prevented them from keeping their number of sexual partners below
four digits.

If I know about it, and don't express my disapproval, it certainly

They advocate sex between adults and children, with NO lower limit on
age.  But that's right, homosexuals don't believe that an adult sodomizing
