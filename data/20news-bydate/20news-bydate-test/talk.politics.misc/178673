Advances in freedom have been made in the past.  The "divine right of
king" concept was questioned at one time and may have used the same
argument, that it hadn't come about before.  But our ancestors had the
courage to throw off the old system that said that one man ruling many
was necessary to have a decent, wholesome society.  In the 1800s the 
concept of slavery was questioned.  Our ancestors had the courage to
question a practice that had existed for thousands of years.  Was
the idea that one man owning another necessary to have a decent, 
wholesome society?  Now libertarians question the necessity of
majoritarianism.  Is it necessary that many people rule over many
others to have a decent, wholesome society?
