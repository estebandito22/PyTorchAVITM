No, what it means is that I, like a majority of environmental scientists/researchers,
agree that El Nino/La Nina and the Southern Oscillations are the systems
involoved in that climatic phenomena categorized by humans as a drought(1988).

Furthermore, in response to an earlier message, the 1992 U.S. est. output of
sulfur dioxide (20 mill. tons) was equivalent to the entire output by the recent
eruption of Mt. Pinautubo(Sp.).  Currently world carbon dioxide levels set at approx.
360 ppm, in the past 120,000 years it has never gone above 280 (this info
was found using ice core samples from the joint French/Russian/U.S. Vostok
project).  Furthermore,  the background emmisions of chlorine compounds into
the atmoshpere is about 0.6 ppb annually, it now sits at 3.5.  This OVERWHELMING
data/info is found in the World Resources doc. published by Oxford University.

The ozone hole in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres keeps getting bigger
and stickin' around longer whilst skeptics ponder how wrong or corrupt all this
data from government and international scientific institutions is.  It is a pity, that,
if the skeptics are wrong and we base our complacency on their Limbaugh
psycho babble, then we will find ourselves strapped by limited options with
which to rectify the primal engineering of our industrial age.
