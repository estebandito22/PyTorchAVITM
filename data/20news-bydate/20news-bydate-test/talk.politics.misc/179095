Do all those who are saying the government is responsible for the death
of those in the compound also say that the Isrealis are responsible
for the death of the Isreali athletes at the Olympics? Hey, the
Palestinians and the Dividians COULD have given up peacefully ('yeah,
and monkey could fly out my butt' - Wayne).
