   On the other hand, Rush made an interesting point: The Democrats ran
   one of their best campaigns in years against a pathetic Republican and
   a paranoiac and still only pulled 43% of the vote, lost 10 seats in
   the House, and gained 0 seats in the Senate.  1994 might be pretty
   interesting.

Clueless of the world, take heart!  57% of the electorate is willing
to vote for "a pathetic Republican and a paranoiac"!!
