	Cancel private health insurance?

	When government care that only covers 20% of the population consumes
42% of the spending for health care?

	NOT!

	National Health Expenditures: 1960 to 1990
(Includes Puerto Rico and outlying areas.)

Year	Health Services and Supplies ($billions)
	Private		Public
====================================
1960	$19.8		$5.7	(22% of total)
1970	$44.1		$24.9	(56% of total)
1980	$140.7		$98.1	(41% of total)
1990	$374.8		$268.6	(42% of total)

	Now you understand where most of that 12.2% of GNP is going--to waste.

	By these figures, private insurance is spending 58% of the money to
cover 4 times as many people.

	Go figure.
