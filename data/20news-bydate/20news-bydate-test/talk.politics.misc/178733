This is not a "studies", but a study.  Other studies, including the
just-published "Janus Report", give very different figures.  The Janus
Report figures are not too different than Kinsey: 9% homosexual men,
and 4% bisexual men.

Don't be stupid.  The Kinsey report is one study, so it can't be "all
over the map" all by itself.  Other studies, including the Battelle
one, have also been criticed.  As far as agendas go, this is really
chutzpah.  *Your* agenda is obvious.
