  I heard the other day that Rush has gotten together with Tammy Faye Baker.
  They were crawling in bed the other night and Rush's feet brushed up against
  Tammy's legs.  "God! your feet are cold" she said.  Rush looked back at here
  and said, "Tammy honey, I told you when we're alone you can just call me
  Rush."  


  Ba dump Bump!  pishhhhh
