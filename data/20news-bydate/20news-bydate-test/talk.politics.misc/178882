Quite true. And evolution made "decided" that homosexuality had a place,
otherwise it would have disappeared quite quickly. There are very few
animals which do not exhibit homosexual behavior.
It has been here before humans existed, and will be here after the
human race has gone.

of man. You tried to rid yourselves of us for 2000 years and failed.
