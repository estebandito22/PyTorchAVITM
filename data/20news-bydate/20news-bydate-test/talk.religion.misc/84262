Dear netters

I am wondering about the accident of Koresh. I have heard different 
explanations.
Without any explanation about your opinions and believes,
 please kindly tell me:

     1)- What was Koresh talking about?. (Or  what was his message)
     2)- What was the main reason that Government went in war with
             Koresh?
(Some say that due to Tax payment, ....)

Thanks in advance for your historical explanation.

Kaamran
