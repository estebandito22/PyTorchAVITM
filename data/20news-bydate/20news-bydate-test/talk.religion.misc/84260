1) Well, Mr Koresh allowed other children and adults to leave the compound
during the course of the siege; why didnt these children leave then?
I dont know myself, and certainly havent heard any answers on this here.

2) Yes, one simple non-action, ie NOT attacking the compound with
modified tanks, would have prevented this tragedy. I bet you blamed
the MOVE people for the deaths that occurred in adjacent row
houses in Philadelphia, not the government which dropped the
firebomb, right?
