Never lived out in the country I see. 4 years ago I had a place
where I had to carry in propane every month, hook the bottle up 
to copper line, to supply both the stove, and a type of water-
heater called a flash-heater. A flash heater has a pilot lamp.

Here's the point. If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked 
up to copper (or some such) lines, run through the ceiling spaces
-- when the FBI started wrecking the place, they could easily have
ruptured the lines. Which then would start spreading out through
the overhead. And since it was a country home, it wasn't necessarily
built with non-flamable insulation. 

It's probably more plausible than anything else, that the fire started
mainly as a result of accident -- or willful negligence on the part of
the FBI, which should have known better (ie. manslaughter).

It's certain that if the tanks hadn't been used that day -- the fire
wouldn't have started.

Paul, what "fact?"
