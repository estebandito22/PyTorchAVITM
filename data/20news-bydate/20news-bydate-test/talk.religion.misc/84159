We have reached the point in our society when there are certain crimes
that are so heinous that to merely be accused with them one is automaticly
considered guilty and deemed not to have any natural rights much less civil 
rights. Among these are drug abuse, sexual perversion, and political 
incorrectness.
Today Billary accused Koresh of having SEX with infants. He had been accused of
a number of differing crimes (inconsistantly) over the last two months, but 
this is the first time I have heard that one. I had heard child abuse but
this is somewhat stronger.
It is fairly obvious that Koresh  was hiding behind the children; and ironicly
considering his apocalyptic dread, believed enough in the American People's
inherent goodness to believe he was protected.
It is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of 
the Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal, crazy, a child abuser and 
a immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersons
had said. Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found
that they have screwed up. 
But they don't have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost.
For in our society as it stands murder is not one of the heinous crimes.
