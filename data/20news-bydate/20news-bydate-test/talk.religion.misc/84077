	Hah!  I have it on the very *best* authority (mine) that Koresh is
whooping it up in a time-share condo in Dallas with Elvis, JFK, and (of course)
J.R. "Bob" Dobbs, who also owns the place and everything else in Texas.
	Look for "koresh" sightings in the Weekly World News and National
Enquirer in the coming months.
