Possibly the parallel just stems from your tending to use bad sources...
Anyway, don't you think that similarity is rather shallow?  You're only
looking at the surface, at the way of argumentation.  
And now you should perhaps go a little deeper and try to find the difference,
for example, find out whether you can find real science done by Hitching.
If you can't, will you then admit that your attempt at quoting an authority
has backfired?

Johannes Scotus Eriugena, the greatest European philosopher of the 9th century,
said that if reason and authority conflict, reason should be given preference.
And if that doesn't sound reasonable to you, you'll just have to accept it...
