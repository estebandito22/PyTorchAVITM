Question for those of you who seem to be fundamentalists (Stephen
Tice, the Cotera, Joe Gaut, et al)(apologies if I've mislabelled any
of you, I've only started reading t.r.m since the BD disaster.  But I
know the Cotera is a fundy) and are defending Koresh and his beliefs
as an example of True Christianity under persecution from the the Big
Bad Secular State: what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits?
If the reports are accurate, what IYO does this say about the quality of
his Christianity?  Or are the allegations just part of the Big
Cover-Up?

(I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: I wouldn't
put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself.  On the other
hand, if the propane-tank-accident story is correct, I wouldn't put it
past the FBI to try to cover its ass by claiming Koresh did it.  I
hope your government does a VERY thorough investigation of the whole
debacle, and I'll be disappointed if a few heads don't roll.  The
authorities seem to have botched the original raid, and in the matter
of the fire, are guilty of either serious misjudgement, or reckless
endangerment.)
