The OED gives the etymology of "sibyl" as coming from the ancient Greek 

	sigma iota beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha 
	( S i b ih l l a )

which is claimed to come from the Doric 

	sigma iota omicron beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha 
	( s i o b ih l l a )

which (if I read it properly) in turn came from the Attican (Athenian)

	theta epsilon omicron beta omicron upsilon lambda eta 
	( th eh o b o ih l ae )

I don't know much about Attis, but it wouldn't surprise me to learn that
this God was tied to the Athenian capital

	Alpha tau tau iota kappa upsilon sigma
	(a t t i k u s)

The OED does not list any etymology for "Cybele" since that is a propper noun,
but I suggest that the Greek spelling of that word would be much closer to
the anticedants of Sibyl than the two words are now. Perhaps "Cybele" is a
French or Latin spelling?
