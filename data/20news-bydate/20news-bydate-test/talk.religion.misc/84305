I am not exactly known as a Flower Child Pacifist, but lets call
cowpoop cowpoop.

"The peaceful attempt to serve the warrant" consisted of the following
actions, in order:

1) BATF agents forcing their entry of the "compound" through second
story windows.

2) BATF agents loosing some grenades (allegedly "stun" or "flash"
grenades) which promptly detonated.

*After* which, according to the tapes I have seen, the B-D
started shooting back.

Now exactly how is it that someone breaking into private property
and tossing grenades around is considered "peaceful" by
*anyone*? You *think* on that.

(Which is not to say I do not still hold my previous and
entirely correct notions about what should be worn and
what arms should be used in assaulting a building.)
