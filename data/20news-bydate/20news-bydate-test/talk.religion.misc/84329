The point about its being real or not is that one does not waste time with
what reality might be when one wants predictions. The questions if the
atoms are there or if something else is there making measurements indicate
atoms is not necessary in such a system.
 
And one does not have to write a new theory of existence everytime new
models are used in Physics.
 
Don't forget to prove your last sentence, namely that sensible don't
accept that.
