    Please excuse the length of this post, but for personal reasons, 
I must go on at some length.

    Perhaps it would be instructive to see what my original post had
to say:

    I was extremely careful in this posting not to say anything which
was not factual.  I made no judgement about Hitching or the quality of 
the quotation attributed to him.  I have not read any of the books 
listed (although I did glimpse briefly at "Earth Magic", I saw nothing 
that I would care to comment on).  It was solely in response to an
inquiry by Warren about Hitching, and your assertion that he is a
paleontologist.  I do not know whether he is or is not a paleontologist.
I do not claim to know anything about him, except this listing of his
publications.

    However, I get the decided impression that I am being included
among the "Branch Atheists" on the basis of this post.  If that 
impression is mistaken, please let me know.  Otherwise, I should let
you know that the implications are very offensive to me, and I 
would certainly appreciate a clarification of your posting.
