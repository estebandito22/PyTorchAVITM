        It should be remembered that all of the first reports came from 
       the FBI, and that independent observers, i.e. the press, were not 
       allowed to get close and see things for themselves.  Official 
       communiques tend to be self-serving for the agencies that issue 
       them. 
        People in general tend to believe first reports, as these get 
       the most and the biggest headlines.  Corrections are often 
       overlooked. 
         An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found 
       in the rubble had bullet wounds.  The local coroner, who is 
       independent of the FBI, has so far found no bullet wounds!
