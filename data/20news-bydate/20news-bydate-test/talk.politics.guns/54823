16. What is the condition of the propane tank mentioned by the BD
survivors? I.e. is it crushed and does it have tread marks on it?

The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
citizens.  Just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe
the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. The
only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
elimination of personal freedom.
