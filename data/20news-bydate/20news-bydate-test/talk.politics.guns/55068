I guess you need to be reminded of some things!  Have you ever heard of the
First Amendment?  I guess not.  It isn't a crime to be a religous (I know
you said "sacraligious", but it isn't your place to judge his religion)
zealot in this country.  REMEMBER we have freedom of religion in this country!
I guess you are selective in that respect!  So what if they were "bastard"
children.  They were CHILDREN!  Do you condone their deaths?  I pray for
your lack of a soul if you do!
