        Interesting that Janet Reno has publically announced that
        we need steal ourselves for more Wacos.  I wonder if I can
        get the gasoline concession.

     Yup.  Kill that bastard!

     Ah, yes.  The ILLEGAL helicopter, searchign for the non-existent
     PCP lab.  I remember it well, even if the media ( and y'all ) tell
     me I don't.  Call me Winston.

      Ahhh, yes.  The "non-existent" canisters.  Call me Winston again.

      Yup.  Good.  Dead.  YEAH!   Maybe Janet will do some more, just
      like she's promis, er, WARNED us about.

      Like I told y'all before.  I would SERIOUSLY consider the following:

        Get your passport in order now.
        Consider overseas options for your savings.
