I suppose it's too late now, but the repeated use of the word
"release" is peculiar.  Let's say you and your family are besieged
in your home by some people with tanks, helicopters, and automatic
weapons.  They give you a break from the amplified sounds of dying
rabbits to blare, "You in there!  Release the children, and they'll
be perfectly all right."  Stipulate on top of that that you may not
have your epistemology entirely in order.  Is it entirely surprising
that the Branch Davidians were reluctant to "release" their children
into FBI custody?
