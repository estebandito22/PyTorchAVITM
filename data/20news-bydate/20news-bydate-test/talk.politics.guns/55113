Subject: MA Senate Bills. HELP!
Keywords: S-897
Lines: 21


Two URGENT requests:

1. I need the latest update and description of MA bill S-897.  From
   what I gather this bill takes the Hunter Safety Courses from
   Law Enforcement and places them under Fish & Game control.

2. Has someone out there compiled a list of all MA Senate & House
   Bills under consideration?  If they have, please e-mail me
   the list.  If not, is there a database I can access?

	Thanx,
		Yours in the fight,
		Mike P.

P.S. My wife and I thought Nancy B. was great on Street Stories.
