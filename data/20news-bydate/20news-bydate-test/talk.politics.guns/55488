You can't think of any valid reason to own a gun that can't wait?

Either you have a very limited imagination or a strange definition of
the word "valid".

Here are a few reasons you might want a gun *right now*:

You're a Korean greengrocer in LA and a riot has just started in a
nearby neighborhood.

You've received a death threat.

Your SO has just broken your arm and you fear for your life if you
stay with him and he's said he'll kill you if you leave him.

A psychopath is breaking into people's houses in your neighborhood and
robbing and killing people inside.

A violent mugger is operating on the route you have to take to get to
your night job.

There are lots of dangers you might be in that won't wait for the
waiting period for you to purchase a gun.
