Catch tonight's (Thursday's) CBS Street Stories.  Covers, among others,
the work of AWARE (Arming Women Against Rape and Endangerment), a women's
empowerment and training group in Massachusetts.  They'll be interviewing
spokesperson Nancy Bittle, as well as some of her students.  (Assuming
all of the "interesting" stuff they taped makes the final cut.)

[If they show the ugly housebreaker in the toque and sunglasses, wave hi.]
