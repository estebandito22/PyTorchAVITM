Those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have 
wondered, "If it wasn't suicide, why did so few get out?"  The 
answer is now available - the gas the government had been pouring
in on them is so disabling that its use in wartime is banned by the
chemical weapons treaty.

The U.S. had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers in
wartime, but used it in peacetime against civilians, including 
nnocent children.

For confirmation see Friday's CLINTON:AM press briefing by George
Stephanopoulous, posted in alt.news-media and other locations.
(When questioned about it, his reply was that the treaty did
not forbid its internal use by law enforcement agencies.
