A really sad op-ed appeared in my school's newpaper today.  It
claimed that full-auto weapons are illegal in the U.S.
I understand that full-auto weapons made and registered before
May 19, 1986 are still legal in 40 of the 50 states.  Is
Texas one of those states?

Can anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been 
killed by legal full-auto weapons in the U.S.?

And finally, I think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digest
of facts on the Waco incident.  In particular, I would like a source
for the FBI/BATF mentioning the supposed methamphetamine lab, and
information on the beginning of the raid, specifically BATF
lies.

I am also interested in past BATF no-knock warrents which have lead
to personal and property damage against innocent citizens.

I intend to put together a reply to this op-ed very soon.  The author
of the piece states he wants to work for the BATF.  gack!
