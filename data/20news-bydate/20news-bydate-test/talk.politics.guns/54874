Just want to make a comment on this.  If you live in this country long
enough, you should realize the media is no friend of the govt.  I am
only concerned about fact that the media like to jump to conclusion
before the facts.  But I am sure they are good in digging dirt as
well; afterall, they like the controversial events, which of course
make news.
