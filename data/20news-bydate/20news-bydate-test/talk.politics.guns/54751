Funny, the medical examiner today stated that there was no
evidence ONE WAY or ANOTHER that there were bullet wounds --
not a single autopsy has been performed, so all reports are
deemed speculative.  INCLUDING reports that there were NO
bullet wounds.

Before long, I think all the kneejerk conspiracy theorists
are going to start getting pretty pissed off at how easily
they mislead themselves.  Also, pretty disappointed at
being ignored by the coutnry.
