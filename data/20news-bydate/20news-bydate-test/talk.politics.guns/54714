Murderous, huh?  Yeah, there was all sorts of carnage going on there in

Damn right.  This is not a partisan thing; it's about individual 
liberties -- the right of a citizen to be left the hell alone.

Maybe they said:

"Our appropriations are coming up soon.  We need a good PR boost.  Let's
find a socially unpopular group who happen to have a lot of guns, go in
