Do I think Clinton conceived of it?  No.
Do I think Clinton ordered it?  No.
Do I think Clinton was aware of it before it went down?  No.
Do I think Clinton was aware of it after it went down?  Of course; who wasn't?
Do I think Clinton prejudged these people to a certain extent because he
                   believed the BATF crap about child abuse and stockpiling
                   "evil semi-automatic weapons?"  Yes.
Do I think Clinton ever questioned federal jurisdiction in this matter?  No.
Do I think Clinton ever considered the civil rights of the victims?  No.

Some of us suspect that ALL the unlawful mistakes made on Day 1 were made 
on the government's end.  That makes days 2-51 nothing but a macho 
alternative to delivering an apology.

Who gives a good goddamn about some bullshit "opinion poll" of "most 
Americans?"  Most Americans swallow the government line that they're fed --
not because they're stupid, but because it's the only line they ever hear.

"Most Americans" thought the staff at the McMaster(?) school was guilty,
guilty, guilty.  Woops, turns out they weren't.  "Most Americans" once
thought that black slaves weren't human beings.  Woops, wrong again.
"Most Americans" thought Saddam Hussein was the Antichrist.  Oh dear,
he was a "special friend of the American government" until two years 
previously.  You know, maybe truth ISN'T determined by majority vote
of a half-informed public after all.

You're just testy because of all those newsbreaks that were interrupting
"Roseanne."
