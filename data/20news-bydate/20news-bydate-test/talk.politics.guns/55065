	Why sell them at a low price to poor people immediately?  The NRA
is an educational organization too, after all, and it would be a shame
to pay all that money for new guns when these cheap guns would allow a
lot of money thus saved to be used in opening more classes.  Mention
that the NRA trains our boys in blue and you've got the media between
a rock and a hard place.

	"City pays $50 per gun to reduce crime."
			or
	"NRA to pay $50 per gun to provide training guns for police
	 and citizens.  Classes expanded with money saved."
