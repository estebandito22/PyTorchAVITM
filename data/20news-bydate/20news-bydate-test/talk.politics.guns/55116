I came across the following notice in the Denver Post classified secction
this morning (April 26, 1993):

\begin{quote}

NOTICE:

The Denver Post will no longer knowingly accept any advertisement to buy
or sell assault weapons.  The Denver Post finds that the use of assault
weapons poses a threat to the health, safety, and security of its readers.

\end{quote}

Now I suppose the Post is within its rights to refuse such ads.  However,
the second sentence is so noxious, I feel compelled to bring it to the 
attention of the t.p.g/c.g readership.  

I called the Post classified number (825-2525) and expressed my displeasure. 
According to the supervisor I spoke to, the Post was reacting to public
complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads.  However, she said
the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy.  I 
strongly encourage Denver Post readers to call and make their feelings known.
