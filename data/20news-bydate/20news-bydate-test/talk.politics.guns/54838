	I keep hearing people say this.  It assumes that we, at some point,
	had a choice at the ballot box: "Vote yes or no I want the FBI
	and BATF to become latter-day Gestapos".  That just isn't so.
	The process is far more complex.  We do not have direct control over
	the bureaucracy.  When we evaluate our representatives we don't often
	know what their contribution is to the wayward direction of the
	federal law enforcement bureacracy.  To assert that we got what
	we wanted is absurd.

	Oh, good I feel much better now. ;-)  

	By the way do you have a plan for getting us out of this mess we
	are in?
