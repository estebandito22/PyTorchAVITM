I've been playing with a program called PICLAB to modify some .gif files. The
problem is it keeps displaying only 50% of the image. Starting from the top, it
displays20%, leaves 20% blank, then down another 20% etc. ANyone know what I'm
doing wrong, or is there another piece of software I should use instead?

Thanks for your tolerance!
