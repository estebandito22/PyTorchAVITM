Sorry, I'm not a rayshade user - but hey, it looks like this group could
use some traffic.  My guess is that "metallic" isn't a color, in the RGB
sense.  Rather, it's a matter of how the surface reflects light.  I'm not
sure what property metallic materials have, that makes them recognizable
as such, but I'm pretty sure any color material can look metallic.
