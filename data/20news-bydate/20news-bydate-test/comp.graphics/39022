Within the next several months I'll be looking for a job in computer
graphics software.  I'm in need of info on graphics software companies. 
I've checked the FAQ, the resource list, and siggraph.org, haven't found
anything.  The last Computer Graphics Career Handbook that I'm aware of,
was published in 1991.  It has a list of 40 companies in it, but no
tremendously specific information on any of them.

Can people please steer me towards more current and in-depth informational
resources?  Thanks.  I'll post a summary if there's interest.

Brandon
