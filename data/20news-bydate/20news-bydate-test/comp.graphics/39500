Can anyone around here point me to information regarding STEREOSCOPIC images?
I believe I saw some at a show room in Texas (Lone Star Illusions)  and 
they were amazing.  I've now heard that they were created with a simple 
graphic program.  Does anyone have any of these images digitized??  
I really want to find a out as much as I can..

					Thanks..
