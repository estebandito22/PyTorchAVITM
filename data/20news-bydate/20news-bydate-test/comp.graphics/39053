I know this has been asked a million time, but..

What was the ftp site carrying 30-40 .ZIPs of full POV "source" files,
including JACK.ZIP and KETTLE.ZIP? I've once been there but
unfortunately lost the address.
I'm in a little hurry with it, so please e-mail me at
jtheinon@kruuna.helsinki.fi. Thanks..

Jarkko
