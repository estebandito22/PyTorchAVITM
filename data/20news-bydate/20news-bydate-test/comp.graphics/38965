	Hello:
	can anybody help me to find a program that converts a format named
	"raw" (also known as "img") to the "gif" format or "jpeg" one.
	It's desirable to be for a unix machine than for a PC.

	(
	"Raw" format of a N*N image is a file that contain a tail of 
	N*N characters, each one referencing to the k*N+j pixel of the 
	monocrome image, where k and j lies between 0 and N-1.
	).
		
	
	Thanxs			mne@ing.puc.cL
