    Yes.  There are many methods of rendering, raytracing is one of them.
You didn't say what you mean by rendering, so I won't guess.  Methods of
rendering include:

        o  Pencil and graph paper, doing the math by hand

        o  Wireframe rendering of the 2D projection

        o  Hidden line rendering

        o  Scanline rendering using:
            - Painter's algorithm.
            - BSP trees.
            - Z buffer
            - Other

        o  Raytracing

        o  Radiosity

        o  Holographic projection to film

        o  Combination of any of the above
