Sorry if this is a FAQ but :

    "Where can I get a 286 (16 bit) version of POV-Ray ? "

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I need the 286 version since Turbo Pascal won't let me run a 32 bit
program from within my program.  Any info on this would also be a
great help.

                                Thanks,

                                    Byron.
