Perhaphs what Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are now is the result of the
natural evolution of a "successful" hacker.  Either you make money, go
to jail (Lee Feldenstein [sp?]), or just fade away as "Oh, that's uncle
so-and-so who *really* likes computers...".

What a "computer hacker" is and does will change as long as the definition
of the word "computer" continues to change.
