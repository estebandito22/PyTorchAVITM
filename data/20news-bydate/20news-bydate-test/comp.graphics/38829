Hello,
I have some problem in converting tga file(generated by POVray) to
rle file. When I convert, I do not get any warning message. But
if I use xloadimage/getx11, something is wrong.

Error messages are,
% targatorle -o o.rle data.tga
% xloadimage o.rle
o.rle is a 0x0 24 bit RLE image with no map (will dither to 8 bits), with gamma of 1.00
  Dithering image...done
  Building XImage...done
xloadimage: X Error: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) on 0x0
xloadimage: X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) on 0xb00003
......

I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm, but I do not spend
time to install them. Even I do not want to generate .rgb from POVray
and then convert them to rle, if possible.(.rgb to rle works, but
it will mess up my directory with so many files, and it needs 2 more
steps to finally convert to rle file. say cat | rawtorle | rleflip )
Does any body out there have same experience/problems ?

Thanks in advance,
