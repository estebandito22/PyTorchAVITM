       I read a mesg. somewhere on GENIE about Intel coming out with a 
graphics standard called PCI, which would supplant VESA standards.  Is
this a rumor, or is there some substance to it. If any of y'all have
heard of this "standard" please e-mail me on how I might obtain more info

Thanks in Advance
