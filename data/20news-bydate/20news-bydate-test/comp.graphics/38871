Greetings this is a general call for information regarding Image
Processing. I am looking for any material related to the field, and am
also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the
field. In particular source code for general use packages.

I already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more
input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. I'm not
mathematically literate (ie. I don't have a degree in mathematics), so
any material that is suggested I would prefer that it was not
mathematically intensive.

The best book I have found on the subject at the moment is:

"Practical Digital Image Processing"
by Rhys Lewis
ISBN: 0-13-683525-2
Published by Ellis Horwood (c)1990.

Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate
Image Processing techniques. So far I have 'xv', and 'khoros' for Unix.
'Dcview 2.1' for the IBM PC, and various related smatterings of C code
to help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement
via convolution etc.

If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software
pertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where I am
most likely to find it on the AARNET (Internet). If I can I would prefer
source code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing
code/algorithms, that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of
demonstration it would be most helpful.

All the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies,
and will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.


          Thanks in advance Vance Ashlin
