I've done a bit of looking, and havn't been able to 
come up with a mailing list or newsgroup for users
of Adobe Photoshop.  Assuming I've just not missed
it, I'll go ahead and see if there is enough interest
to start a mailing list (and/or alt. newsgroup).

Drop me a note if  you might be interested in subscribing.

THANKS!
