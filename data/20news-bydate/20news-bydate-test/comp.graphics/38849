	Hi!
	Does anybody know any reliable utils to read english texts with scanner?
	I want some analysis on quality of recognition, because I want to read
	texts which I get by fax ( you know -- quality on faxes is rather bad ).
	The scanner I have is B&W and 300dpi. But if there exist any good software
	that needs other specifications, that will be OK.
	
	Please, send messages to my E-mail or on conference server, I'll summarize
	them and consider your recomendations.
	
	THANK YOU!!!
