Hi there,

I'm looking for help on hi-rez CGA modes (hey, i know it sounds crazy but at
the moment it's got to do). My card's manual says it does something like
640 by 400 2 colour and 640 by 200 4 colour (the card has 64k memory). Could 
anyone give me some help on how to implement these modes (Assembly language 
is fine). Any other usefull tips on the CGA regs will also help.

Thanx in advance...

Frans.
