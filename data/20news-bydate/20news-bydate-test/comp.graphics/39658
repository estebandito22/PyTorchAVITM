    Hi folks,

I'm doing an animated film on new methodes in loom
research (You know, the thing they make cloth with.)
and need a model of a loom. The format should be 
in ascii faceted geometry and fairly straight
forward to figure out. Any help or pointers would be
greatly appreciated.

-Thanks

Rick Boykin
