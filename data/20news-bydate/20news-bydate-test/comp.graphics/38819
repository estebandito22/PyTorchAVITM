I'm planning on writing several classes to build a raytracing/radiosity library
on top of, and i'm wondering if anythink like this is freely available on the
net before i go to it. What i need is classes like rays, vectors, colors,
shaders, surfaces, media, primitives, worlds (containing primitives) and
views/images.

Please post or mail.
