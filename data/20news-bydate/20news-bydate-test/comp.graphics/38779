I am looking for a small utility that will convert a Microsoft Video (AVI)
file to an Autodesk Animator Pro (FLC) file. Since AVIs also contain sound,
it would be nice if this utility also stored the sound track as a WAV or VOC
file. Currently I'm accomplishing this by saving the AVI as multiple DIBs
using Video for Windows, then converting each DIB to a GIF, then loading the
GIFs into Animator. For the sound, I load the original AVI into WavEdit and
save it as a seperate WAV file. This requires too many steps to be productive.

Any help will be GREATLY appreciated.

          Thanks
             Don
