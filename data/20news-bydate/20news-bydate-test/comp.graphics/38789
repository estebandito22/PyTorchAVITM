Could anyone tell me the format of GIF files.  I would like to know how I 
could determine the size of the picture.  Also, are gif files in compressed
format?  How many bits store pixel color information?  

(This is probally a simple question, but I couldn't find it in the FAQ.)

email responses would be perferred
