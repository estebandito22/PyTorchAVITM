Hi,
  I need to know if there is a 256 color graphics mode that allows multiple
pages.  I want something like mode 0x10 (640x350x16 2 pages).  I have been
experimenting with graphics by calling the BIOS with borland turbo c.  I
feel like I am flying blind in this area, and could use all the help that
you can give.

  Thanks,
	Ivan......
