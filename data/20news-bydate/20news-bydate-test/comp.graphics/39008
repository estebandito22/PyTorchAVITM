STOP! STOP! STOP! STOP! This argument is getting silly! XV-3.00 now handles
24-bit images without quantizing them. All these arguments are moot, null, 
and void. Please stop quibbling about a now obsolete version of the program.

Besides, you can now generate tons of verbiage about the new shareware
licensing it uses instead ...
