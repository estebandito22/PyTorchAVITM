Subject: wanted, how to do a screen dump of a VGA screen
Organization: Project Zed
Lines: 14

	How can one dump to the printer, the content of a VGA screen. If it were
a text screen, we can execute a shift printscr. but with graphics, we have
to do a pixed by pixel print. It would be greatly appreciated if someone can
supply source code for this. Alternately, are there commercial or shareware
programs that are available to do this. I must be able to shell out of my 
program to execute this print screen.  Therefore, it would be prefferable to have source code.

Thank you in advance
