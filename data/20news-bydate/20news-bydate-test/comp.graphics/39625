      I was skimming through a few gophers and bumped into one at NIH
   with a database that included images in .GIF format.  While I have
   not yet worked out the kinks of getting the gopher client to call
   an X viewer, I figure that the majority of the users here are not
   in an X11 environment - instead using DOS and MS-Kermit.

      With Kermit supporting Tek4010 emulation for graphics display,
   does anyone know of a package that would allow a Tek to display a
   .GIF image?  It would be of more use to the local population to
   plug something of this sort in as the 'picture' command instead of
   XView or XLoadImage ...
