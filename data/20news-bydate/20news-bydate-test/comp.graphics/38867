I had the same problem and called the people who handle the box; the
problem happened some time ago and was caught almost instantly.  All
registrations going to that address are now fixed.  See what trouble
you get into when you don't procrastinate, Mike?

And no, SIGGRAPH 93 has not skipped town -- we're preparing the best
SIGGRAPH conference yet!
