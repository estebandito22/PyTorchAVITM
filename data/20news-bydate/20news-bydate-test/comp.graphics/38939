A word of warning for those of you registering for SIGGRAPH '93.
I just received my registration form back in the mail with the
envelope marked "Return to sender. Moved - Left No Address.
Closed PO Box". The address I used to register for SIGGRAPH '93
is the one printed on the registration form:

     ACM SIGGRAPH '93
     PO Box 95316,
     Chicago, IL 60694-5316

I printed the envelope in my best printing, honest but evidently
SIGGRAPH '93 has skipped town or moved?

I ended up faxing my registration to: 312-321-6876. I hope that
number is real!
