I need help in creating my 4x4 perspective matrix.  I'd like to use this for
transforming x, y, z, w in some texture mapping code I got from Graphics Gems
I.  I have many books which talk about this, but none of them in simple plain
english.  If you have Graphics Gems I, I'm talking about page 678.

I'd like to have a perspective matrix that handles different field-of-views
and aspect of course.  Thank's for your help.

Yes, of course everything I say is my personal opinion!
