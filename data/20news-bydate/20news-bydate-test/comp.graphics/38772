Has anyone seen hallusions?  You can buy a poster of them and it looks like a simple dot pattern
when you first look at it but if you focus behind it you see a 3d picture.  I'm looking for
a program that generates these pictures.  There's a company in Texas that makes them but I 
doubt if they're giving the program away.  Any help would be appreciated.
