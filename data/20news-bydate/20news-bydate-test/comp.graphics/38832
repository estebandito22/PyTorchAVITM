Subject: Triangulized Data Wanted : with texture to be mapped.
Organization: Indiana University Computer Science, Bloomington

I need triangulized data of some nice looking model with some
texture mapping. It would be better if the parametric values
of each vertex( for the surface before triangulized ) are
avaliable along with the Euclidean points so that we
could use them for texture mapping.

Thanks, Kwansik
