There might be an IPAS routine that does that,but I can'r be sure.  Another
way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the
image.  Then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection.  It will
take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection, but that's
the only thing I can think of.
