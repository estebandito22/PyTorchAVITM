Lines: 23


I need recommendations on imaging workstations. As a minimum, I have the
following requirements:

- High resolution graphics (Black and white) for display of Fax images.
- Support the display of multiple simulataneous windows:
     Fax image, 3270 emulation window to IBM host, etc...
- High speed network interface for 3270, image data, etc...
     (16Mb Token ring, EtherNet, etc...)
- Mouse


Any information/experience would be appreciated.

Thanks,


car.
