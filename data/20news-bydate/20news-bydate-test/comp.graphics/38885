hi netters,

	I'm doing a project which is about image analysis.  Firstly, I
have to find out any restrictions or limitations on the colour display
on various kind of workstations, they are DECstation, HP, Amiga, Apollo.

	Secondly, I read from some graphic texts that image is displayed
in 24 bites(please point out to me if I got it wrong).  But, the images
which I will deal with are displayed in 16 bites by the software they
are using currently.  So, will there be any problems to display them
under X-windows in the future? Because we are thinking to implement the
GUI by X-windows for our project


	Is there any person here can help me to solve the problem or
query above?  Or, give me some advice or suggestion where I can find
them out. 

	Please send me an e-mail if there are any.  Thanks in advance.
