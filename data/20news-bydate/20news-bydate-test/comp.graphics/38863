Hi all,
	I am working on a project in which I need to brake an image
into sub-bands and then work with them.  Since I have never done
anything like this, don't even understand the concept of sub-bands, I
was wondering if there is some software out there that would allow me
to do this.  Any hints?
Thanks,
