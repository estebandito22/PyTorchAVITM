Hello there!
A few days ago I got a mail concerning bitmap-stretching
from SCOTT LEATHAM @ Microsoft Redmond WA, USA.
I really would like to answer back to him, but I have 
lost his email-address.
So if Scott or anybody that knows his email-address
reads this, please mail me his address so I can
answer his mail.

Please mail to : d91tm@efd.lth.se

	Thanks
	  /Tomas
