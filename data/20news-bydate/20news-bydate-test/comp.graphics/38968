	I'm interested in obtaining the highest possible image capture in a 
MS-Windows application. The resulting image must go to print and high resolution
is the name of the game. I'm familiar with (and unhappy with) composite video
capture technology. What kind of resolution can I get out of an SVHS signal? 
What about RGB (and who makes RGB cameras)? Does anyone have any experience
with digital cameras? 

Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.
