Don't mind if I do.
As someone who would _love_ to see XV go to 24 bit, this
would be plenty for me.

    a) XV can Load a 24 bit image, and display it in all it's
24 bit glory on 24 bit X displays.
    b) All other operations (Crop, Dither, Smooth, etc.) are not
supported on 24 bit images.

how hard would this be?
