Due to a number of bugs in GKS4.1 under SUNOS 4.1.3, I installed
patches 100533-15 and 100755-01. Patch 100533-15 appears to
work fine and has fixed a number of problems. Patch 100755-01,
however, which is required to fix a number of other annoying
bugs, breaks with our applications.

Is there a more recent revision of patch 10075?

Any other ideas?
