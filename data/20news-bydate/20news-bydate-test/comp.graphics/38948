Can anyone provide me with a colour space transform that would
emulate the effects of red/green colour blindness? I have had
a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.
Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?

I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow
previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour
blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!

Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is
sufficient interest
