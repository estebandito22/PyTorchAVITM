I currently have some grayscale image files that are not in any
standard format.  They simply contain the 8-bit pixel values.  I would
like to display these images on a PC.  The conversion to a GIF format
would be helpful.  This conversion can take place either on a PC
or on a UNIX system and I could then download it to the PC.
Can anyone suggest where I can find software to do this?  Alternatively, I
may have to write my own conversion program.  In this case, could someone
tell me where I can find the GIF format specification?

Please e-mail me directly at: shayla@shannon.jpl.nasa.gov

Thanks.
