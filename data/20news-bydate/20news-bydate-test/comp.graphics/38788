Does anyone truely understand the "INVALID NORMAL ARRAY" error 3ds gives
you while rendering?  It seems to present itself while rendering
complicated images.  I have circumvented this problem by rendering at
the command line, however it would be nice to render inside the editor.
Is this a memory problem???
