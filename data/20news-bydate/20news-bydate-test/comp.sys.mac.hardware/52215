I ordered an external floppy drive from them 2 years ago.  When I placed
the order, they said it was in stock and would ship the next day.  A week
passed and no drive.  I called them up and they said they were out of stock
and my drive should ship in 2 weeks or so.  Since I needed the drive right
away (both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead) I cancelled my
order and haven't dealt with them since.
