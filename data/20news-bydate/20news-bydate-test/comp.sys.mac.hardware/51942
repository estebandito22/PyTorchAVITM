Hello. I have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the
powerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). Is there a
difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus
any other mac, say plus or ii?? I have heard, though not confirmed
by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds.

I also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem
allowing speeds just as any other serial port.

My particular use is that I have a 6811 EVB board that I need to
interface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud. 
Currently, we are interfacing using mac pluses.  I set everything
up just as in lab and nothing.  In fact, the powerbook locks up.

Can anyone help, inform, advise? I would appreciate it.  
I would prefer email since I don't read the news at all.
I will post a summary if enough response is generated.

Thanks.
