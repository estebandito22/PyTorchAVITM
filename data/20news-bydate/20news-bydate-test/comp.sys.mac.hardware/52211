   I'm looking for the best source for SIMMs in the USA. I'm not looking for
   the lowest prices, but rather for the best quality SIMMs and the one with
   the lowest rate of defective SIMMs. I know the chip Merchant has good 
   prices but they seems to have a high rate of returned SIMMs.
   Does anyone know how many SIMMs you have to purchase to obtain quantity
   discount ?.
   Thank you.
