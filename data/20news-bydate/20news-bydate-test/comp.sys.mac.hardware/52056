We just received an AppleOne Color Scanner for our lab.  However,
I am having trouble getting reasonable scanned output when printing 
a scanned photo on a LaserWriter IIg. I have tried scanning at a 
higher resolution and the display on the screen appears very nice.  
However, the printed version is coming out ugly!  

Is this due to the resolution capabilities of the printer?  Or are 
there tricks involved to get better quality?   Or should we be 
getting something (like PhotoShop) to "pretty up" the image?
I will appreciate any suggestions.

Thanks in advance,

-Kris
