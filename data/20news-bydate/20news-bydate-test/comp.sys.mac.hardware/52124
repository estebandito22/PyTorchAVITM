Is it possible to rip an external SyQuest removable drive out of its
external casing and install it into the 5 1/4" empty bay slot on a
Centris 650? I know a special bracket would need to be purchased, but
is there any power hookup/SCSI constraints that would prevent it? If
anyone has done it, could they mail me some instructions. It doesn't
seem to be that overwhelming an undertaking.
