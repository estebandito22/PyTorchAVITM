Iv'e got a problem printing with a StyleWriterII. I am printing from a IIvx
with 20 megs ram. I am trying to print a Quark file that has 2 fonts a couple
of boxes and 3 gradient fills. 

Two things happen: I get a " Disk is full" error, that I can't find documented,
I also have parts of letters that are over one of the gradient fills get cut
off. This only happens to the text over the fill. Text adjecent in a different
box is uneffected.

Any ideas?

Thanks for the help...--
