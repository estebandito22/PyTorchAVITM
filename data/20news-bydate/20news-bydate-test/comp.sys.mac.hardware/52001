Does anyone out there know where some one can become educated in the art of
repairing Macintosh computers?  Also, how does one gain the prestige of being
refered to as a Authorized Apple Service person?  Has anyone out there actually
done any of this or maybe even know someone who did.  I would appreciate any
and all comments on this subject.
