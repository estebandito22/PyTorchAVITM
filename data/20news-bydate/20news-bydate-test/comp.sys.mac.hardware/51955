Can anyone tell me the procedure for hooking a Personal Laserwriter NTR
serially to a mac?  The documentation says it can be done, but I'm not sure of
the correct switch setting to use out of the given non-appletalk switch
options.  Also, will I need to install a new driver so that the Chooser knows
the printer is hooked up directly (not networked)?

Thanks a lot,
Ross
