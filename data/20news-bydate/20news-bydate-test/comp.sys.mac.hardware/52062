In light of the 100 letter over "What was the LISA" I thought I'd start a
new one.  What was the IIvx?  I hear it was some machine that predated the
main 040 line by about 6 mos, but used obsolete tech.  Rumor has it that
several were sold....

<Really, I'm just tired of the repetitive nature of this type of dialog>
<Plus, flaming is stress relief>
