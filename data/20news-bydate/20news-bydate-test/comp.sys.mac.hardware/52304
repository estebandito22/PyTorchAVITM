I am running System 7.1 on a Centris 610. I have not been able to setup my
printer yet because when I open Chooser, I get a blank screen. I do have all
kinds of print drivers but none shows up. I even do not get a port iconn
either. It is just one big BLANK screen.

Your help is very appreciated. 
BTW I did rebuild the desktop but that did not help either.
