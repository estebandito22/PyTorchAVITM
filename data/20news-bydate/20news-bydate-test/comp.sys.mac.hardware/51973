I would like to know the regular/international phone number of a computer
supplier called "Computer Component Source". Their free phone number is
1-800-356-1227. This number is no use to customers outside the US.
I wish to upgrade the power supply on a couple of Mac Plus computers and would
like to make contact with "Computer Component Source".
