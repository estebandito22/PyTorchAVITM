What is the maximum rate of the 6882 FPU that Apple sells directly (Apple
Part No. M6775 LL/A)?  The Apple literature labels the FPU for Classics and
LC III's so I assume it will do at least 25MHz.  My question is can I put
it in a Performa 600 (68030 @ 32MHz)?  The Apple price is cheap at $78
compared to ~$135 from mail order houses.  Any one know the answer to this
one?
