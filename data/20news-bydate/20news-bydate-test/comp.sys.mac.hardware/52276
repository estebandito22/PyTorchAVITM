	OK...here is my question.  I want to hook up my PowerBook 160 to
a SVGA monitor but I do not want to buy the PowerBook/DOS Companion.  Can
anyone tell me the EXACT cable I need to connect them?  If there is such
a cable, can I purchase it from MacWharehouse or some computer store?
If I must buy the cable from James Engineering, how much do they run and
how can I get a hold them???  I guess that was more than 'a' question.  :)
Thanks in advance for any replys.
