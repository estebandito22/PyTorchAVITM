There are two approaches:

1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the
monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go
from the monitor to the back of the computer.

2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing
power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the
computer.

Both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer
stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at
good prices). Power cords are standard, so you don't have to go looking
for some special thing at a Mac store.
