I recall that Ehman 'died'...

Can anyone suggest what the problem is when the picture jumps
about an inch any direction?

Two page monchrome monitor connected to Newlife accelerator and 
video board in an SE... At the end of the work day, several hours
with power on, the picture will occasionally jitter a couple of times
and then remain calm for a few minutes. Then it does more shaking...

The environment around the computer appears to be stable. Nothing
newly introduced near the computer. 

Any ideas? Please e-mail to carsona@sfu.ca or reply here.

Also... Has anyone used Ehman two page with Powerbook video? What
was required? Just a cable adapter?

Thanks for any help!

PS I think the monitor is a Zenith mechanism...
