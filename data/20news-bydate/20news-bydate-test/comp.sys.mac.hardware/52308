Can anyone recommend a 3 button mouse that is compatible with MacX and Quadra?
If so, can the buttons be programed to say, cut, paste etc?

Can anyone suggest a supplier?

The only 3 button mice I know exist are:

	1. Logitek	$106.00 Aust (Injan ).
	2. Anorus	$100.00 Aust (Mac direct).
Are these ok for the above configuration?

Please reply me directly.

regards
Christopher Welsh
