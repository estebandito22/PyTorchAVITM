Is there a way to connect a PowerBook 145, Mac IIsi, and Personal LaserWriter
LS so that I can (not necessarily silmultaneoulsy) print from either the IIsi,
or PB, and file share between the IIsi and PB?
I know I can get the ($expensive$) LW NT upgrade for my LS, but I can't afford
that...
 
Thanks, Mark
