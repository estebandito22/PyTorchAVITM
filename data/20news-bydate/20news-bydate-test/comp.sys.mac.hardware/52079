Has anyone else gotten a system error when trying to print from Mathematica 2.1
to the HP Deskwriter. I'm using a PB170 with:	8 megs ram
						Sys 7.0.1 + Tuneup
						HP Print Drivers etc....

It works find on an Imagewriter I. I'd like to get as much information as
possible before I send a bug report to Wolfram.

Thanks.
