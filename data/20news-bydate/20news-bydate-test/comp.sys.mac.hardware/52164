Subject: Re: Why the drive speeds differ??
Lines: 11

The most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a
greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than
the smaller one. If your running the drive on a Mac I would recommend a
shareware utility called Timedrive which tests seek, SCSI throughput and
rotational speed. This utility should let you know what the differences are
between the drives.
