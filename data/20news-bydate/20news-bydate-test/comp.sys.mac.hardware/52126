I vote for turning them off at night.  THe stress of off/on is a little 
harmful, so don't turn it off, then back on an hour later, etc, but
turning them off for 4-5 hours or overnight is a good idea.

The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, along
with heat. 

We have a lot of 10-year old machines in the basement that still work, but
who cares? (they are off 24 hours a day).
