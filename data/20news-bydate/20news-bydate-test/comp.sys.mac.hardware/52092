I have a PLP II laser printer make by GCC Technologies.  I have problem
with a dirty first page.  The top portion of the first is always smeared
with black toner across the page.  If I print more than one page at the 
same time, the problem does not occur on other pages.  I cleaned the
printer but still does not help.  Can anyone offer any solutions?
or know the phone # to GCC Technologies?

Thanks in advance
