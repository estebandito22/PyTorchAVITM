What would be a good platform for some fairly basic video work of the
following nature:

Reading real video in for playbak in various app's 5-10 Minnutes in length
Basic editing features for said video - rearange sequences, adding grapic
slides from something like power point etc... 

I'm not to familiar with this stuff but would like a good system with crisp
performance.  It's for educational/promotional things so the video quality
should be decent.

I'm thinking Tempest or cyclone, Big drive,loads o ram, Floptical or 128Mb
optical ?? - however, I'm not to sure of the various cards and software
thats out there.

Please email any responses,

Thanks
