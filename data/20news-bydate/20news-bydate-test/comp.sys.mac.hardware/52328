I've had my C610 for about six weeks now with no problems whatsoever.
It's been "customized" with---

 * replaced the Apple-Quantum 80 drive with a Connor 212 drive.  

 * installed a Tandberg SCSI tape drive in the internal bay which works
   just fine (though Apple doesn't seem to be supplying front panel
   bezels w/ a standard 5.25" cutout...).  

It's hooked up to an Apple LaserWriter Plus and has no printing
problems at all, tested printing complex Photoshop graphics.

It has expanded VRAM and extra 8 meg SIMM, no problems.

So in sum, I have no idea what this dealer is complaining about.
