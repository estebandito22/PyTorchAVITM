I just ordered my subscription today.  Call MacWeek's Customer Service
Dept. at (609) 461-2100 and quote some plastic.  If you forget the number,
it's included in the statement of ownership, which is on the contents 
page of the copy I have.  A one year subscription costs $99.00 in the U.S,
Canada, or Mexico.  I was told my first issue would arrive in 4-6 weeks.
