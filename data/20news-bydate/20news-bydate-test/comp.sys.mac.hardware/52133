I have also moved on to a 66.6 mhz clock. Thus far not problems. I'm not totallysurprised as I've had Q700 run at 35.4 mhz (CPU clock speed) using a VSO. My
25 mhz rated Daystar QuadraCache got very hot at 32 mhz and would fail previously. I glued on a piece of aluminum stock to the hi speed RAM chips and it runs
cool without problems at 33.3 mhz. The combination is faster than a Q950.
