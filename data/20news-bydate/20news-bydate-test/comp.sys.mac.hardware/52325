Thanks for the enlightening post.  Is there a Technical Note on this?

The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac,
but rather, any of various workstations that use the
68030@25MHz, such as old Suns or old NeXTs.  I used to own a NeXT
68030 cube.   

But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of
a speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo. I did notice an
extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after
installing system 7 on it.  Why does the OS suck up so much CPU
power? 

Also, you're right--software does make a HUGE difference.  I
have the misfortune of using MS-Works on my Duo.  When editing
relatively small (40K) files, cut or copy takes several
seconds, often more than 6 seconds!!  This happens with power
cycling turned off.  As usual, MS software is maggot-infested
feces. 
I'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing.
