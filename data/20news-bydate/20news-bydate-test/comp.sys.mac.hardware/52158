	Performa 200 == Classic II
	Performa 400 == LC II
	Performa 4xx == LC III
	Performa 600 == well, nothing :)

	The Performas are made to be low-cost business solutions.  The 4xx have
bundled software, modems, etc.
	Because they have no "retail price" you might be able to get a steeper
discount on them.  Shop around.

	As far as the monitors go, buy 3rd party.  Much cheaper.
