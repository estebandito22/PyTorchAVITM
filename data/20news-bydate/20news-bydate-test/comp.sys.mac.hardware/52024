Subject:    Mac II vi to be discontinued. Good buy?
Lines: 15

A local dealer is offering Mac II vi machines equipped with Kodak multi-
session compatible CD-ROM drives for what seems like an attractive price:
$1500. I've used many other models up to a II ci, but this would be the
first I could have my own Mac. Is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinued
model such as this. I'd like to yank the CD-ROM drive out, put it in a
housing and share it with my PC. Is this feasible? The only info I have on
the II vi is that it is relatively slow (16MHz), has an 68030 chip with a
math coprocessor. I want to add a non-Apple portrait monitor and use this
machine for HyperCard stack design. Is this a good buy, or would I be
wasting my money? I would appreciate some advice. Thanks!
