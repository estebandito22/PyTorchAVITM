Hello
	I recently accelerated my Mac Plus (MicroMac 25MHz accelerator) 
and now I can't get my Mac to boot off of the hard disk.  It boots fine 
from a floppy, and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe, but I 
cannot get it to boot from the hard drive.  I installed a new driver, so I 
don't think that is the problem.  
	This poses a rather large problem.  I only have 4 Meg of RAM, and 
I need to run Mathematica, which requires 5 Meg.  I was hoping to use 
system 7 virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica.  However, I can't 
run system 7 from a floppy, so I can't get enough RAM.  
	Any suggestions? Thanks for your time--
