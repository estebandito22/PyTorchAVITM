I believe that that would be the same as a system error #64. Since there is no
error #64, then I would guess that it would be a -64 error. Which is a font
manager error of "error during font declairation".

I would assume that the system that's on the floppy that you are trying start
up on has a corrupted font in it, or something like that.
