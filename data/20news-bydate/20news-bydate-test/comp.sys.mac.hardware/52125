What is the real story here? Can I hook up any PC SVGA Montitor to the
Centris internal video? Do I need to make my own cable if it doesn't not
come with one? Has apple released a Tech note with the pinouts for doing
such? The reasoj I ask is that it seems the prices for SVGA are lower than
that of their mac counterparts...
