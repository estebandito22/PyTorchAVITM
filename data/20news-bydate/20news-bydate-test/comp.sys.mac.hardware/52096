Hi!

I am looking for a source of lithium batteries for an original Mac II.  The
number on the battery is ER 1/2 AA.  Local electronic shops & computer stores
freak when inquire.  The fastest any of them can get a battery to me is 2-3
weeks for about $20.  Anything faster and/or cheaper is welcome!

Please respond to me via e-mail and I will summarize to the net.

Note my e-mail address differs from the return address of this posting.

Thanks in advance for your help!
