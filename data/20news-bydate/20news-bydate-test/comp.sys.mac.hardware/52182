I was reading a review of the Centris 610 in this 
months MacWorld and the reviewer said that for 
$4 you could make an adjustment on the clock speed
of the chip and change it from 20mhz to 25mhz.  I 
haven't heard of this before, and I don't think that
this is the 040 chip replacement (with fpu) that I have
seen so much talk about.  Anyone have any ideas?
