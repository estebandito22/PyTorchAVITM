This happens intermittently to Macs in our department, ranging from IIsi's
to a Quadra 950.

I can end the slowdown immediately by unplugging the Ethernet cable from
the Mac. It seems that something on the network puts out these packet
storms every few days. These storms have the effect of making our Macs
slow down to a crawl.
