I recently made the mistake of purchasing a SONY CPD-1320 monitor for my
Mac IIci.  The monitor is very good, however it seems that the IIci does not
support VGA (then why did you buy it you ask?  I am stupid I reply).  What I
am looking for is a video card, preferably 8 bit, which supports VGA.  I am
interested in any information I can get.  Offers for the sale of applicable
cards will also be considered.  

Thanks in advance.
