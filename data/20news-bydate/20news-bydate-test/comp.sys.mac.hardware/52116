Subject: NEC 5FGe vs NEC 5FG
Article-I.D.: eis.C5uHFw.80p
Organization: Calif State Univ/Electronic Information Services
Lines: 13

We were told that the resolution on the 5FGe could only go to 1024x768.

And that the 5 FG could go to 1152x870.

Has anybody tried running these higher resolutions??

Somewhere I thought I read that the 1152x870 on a 17" monitor may make the
type too small to read.

Any help would be appreciated.
Steve
