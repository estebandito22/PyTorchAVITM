The supplemental manual that comes with the Quadra 800 explains it. I
don't have the manual in front of me, but as I recall, you insert the CD
while the machine is running, select Restart from the special menu, and
then hold down a special sequence of keys to force it to boot from the CD
instead of the hard disk. I think the key combination is
Command-Option-Delete or Command-Ctrl-Del.
