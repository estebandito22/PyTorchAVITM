I have a small network running in my dorm at school, and I am kind of
worried about the length of the wires and the way that I have run it.
I was wondering if anyone might have some schematic or at least some
ideas on how to make some sort of simple appletalk repeater.  I'm not
so interested in making actual zones and zone names, just a way to
isolate different branches of the network.

Does anyone have any ideas on what could be done??

Thanks alot,
Dave Sugar
