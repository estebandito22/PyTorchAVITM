I used to hate it when people posted messages like this, but now that I
am contemplating a purchase, I can see why they do.

So, has anyone heard of any upcoming (within the next 6 months)
advances in the Powerbook line?  Can we expect to see a PowerPC
PowerBook at some point in the future (I assume an 040 would take too
much power and generate too much heat for installation in a PowerBook)?

Thanks for your help.
