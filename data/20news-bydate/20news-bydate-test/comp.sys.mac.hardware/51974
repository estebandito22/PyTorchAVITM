Hi,

I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this
LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board.
My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882
on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively,
the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but
I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when
it comes to throughout. Does anyone know the answer to this or have
any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter? Thanks in advance.

Andy
