Urgent help needed. Daughter has SE 30 and Imagewriter II. Worked well until
yesterday. Now when she tries to print from Macwrite II or Acta the printing
message comes on, but not printing! Bought new cable, still no printing. Moved
cable to modem port, still no printing! I'm a DOS person and don't know where
to begin. Are there diagnostics for a MAC?
