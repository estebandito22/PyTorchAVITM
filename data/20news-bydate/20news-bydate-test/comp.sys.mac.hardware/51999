I have found that you should observe the following with almost all new
equipment :

Check for warrany tape.  If none, carefully open unit.

Inspect for loose wires, jumpers, screws, and other trash.

Clean up these manufacturing mistakes.

*Now* power up the unit and check it out.

I can't think of how many things I've bought that weren't okay right out of
the box due to sloppy QC.

PS : This goes for any manufacturer.  I'm not picking on anyone.
