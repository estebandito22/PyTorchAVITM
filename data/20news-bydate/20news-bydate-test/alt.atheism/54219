	That is not an "atheism mythology" in any sense of the word.
"Religious paradoy" would be significantly more appropriate.

	The 2nd part is rendered null and void by the simple fact that I
do know several "strong" atheists. I am sure that others do. I myself am
"strong" in the sense that I find the standard concept of God without any
meaning. Any attempt to bring meaning either results in the destruction of 
the viability of language, or in internal self contradiction. 

	The concept of strong atheism is not just a whimsical fantasy. They, 
and I, exist.

	Your strawman is pointless and weak.
