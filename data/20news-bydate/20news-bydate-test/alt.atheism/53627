Yes, unless the observer is at rest with respect to the singularity at
infinite distance away. But an observer on a close approach to the BH will
see the particle go in in finite time.

Don't forget to sing:
            They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
                Some say it's better, but I say it ain't
        I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
                     The sinners are much more fun
                         Only the good die young!
