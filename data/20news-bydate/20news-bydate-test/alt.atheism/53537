Kevin makes a good point here, and when that theists miss all-too-often.  That
is, the belief in a diety is not necessarily coupled with agreement/love of
that diety, so really they have yet another bit of convincing to do just beyond
belief.
I guess the standard argumet goes something like: well, once you believe in
God, you know God is love, and you will choose to love him-- if it wasnt so
widely accepted and asserted it'd be laughable...
