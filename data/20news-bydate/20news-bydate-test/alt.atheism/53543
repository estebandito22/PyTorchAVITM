hold on there: no meaning to "consciousness" or "mind" or "self"?!

what illogicality?

since when is, for instance, (non-behaviourist) psychology a pipe dream? 
Surely the major purpose of the science of psychology is to understand the
workings of the mind.

"manifestations of the mundane" sounds rather transcendental to me. In fact
"matter", "energy", "space" and "time" are well measured but mysterious
concepts.
