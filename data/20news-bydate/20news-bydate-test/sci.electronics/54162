   Where can I buy blinking LEDs besides radio shack? 


  * Does anyone sell blinking LEDs with variable flash rate? (by voltage
    I guess) If so, what hertz (pulse) rate are they adjustable or set to?

     I'd like blinking LEDs that can be set for approx 5 hz, 10 hz, 
     15 hz, or 20 hz. Something like that... I'm interested in what's
     out there for flash rates. I like the idea of LEDs with flasher 
     circuits already in them. I hate soldering ICs in general. Guess I
     don't have a hell of a lot of patience. 


      Thanks,

         Dana
