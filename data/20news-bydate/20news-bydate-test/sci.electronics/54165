Can anyone offer a suggestion on a problem I am having?
I have several boards whose sole purpose is to decode DTMF tones and send
the resultant in ASCII to a PC.  These boards run on the serial interface.
I need to run * of the boards somwehat simultaneously.  I need to be able to ho
ok them up to a PC>  The problem is, how do I hook up 8+ serial devices to one
PC inexpensivley, so that all can send data simulataneously (or close to it)?
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
