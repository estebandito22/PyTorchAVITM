   Two things to watch for:
   In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some
   of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the
   phone can be set to pulse dialing.

Most (if not virtually all) swedish exchanges can handle tone
dialling. Many older electromechanical exchanges have been modified
accept tone dialling.
