	I'm trying to bring in 8+ bits to a PC, and would like
	to use interrupt-driven routines. Without buying an IO
	board or making a new port, _where_ can I bring in these
	bits? LPT seems to have only a few inputs, but I've heard
	rumours that some LPTs have bidirectional lines. Anybody
	know fer sure? If any bi-d LPTs, which boards have them
	(I'll be running a new 386DX-33)?
