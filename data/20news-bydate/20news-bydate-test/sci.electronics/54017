	I got mine for about 7 bucks at Radio Shack.  The instructions
DO say to expose it to light for a while, but mine doesn't seem to require 
very much to make it work.

	I just wish I could get a big sheet of the stuff, abouit 12" x 12"
for a reasonable price.....it isn't cheap, from what I've seen.
