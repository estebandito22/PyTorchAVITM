This has been an interesting thread to follow... and obviously this group
wasn't intended as a forum for the discussion of piracy... Has anyone seen
any estimates of the lost revenue due to pirates?  I was wondering if
piracy is more rampant in Home or Corporate computing environments.  I would
tend to think that business environment "piracy" is the major contributor to
this form of lost revenue.  So many companies will purchase a few copies of a
software package and then employees will internally distribute them as if they
owned a site-license!  What do you guys think?
