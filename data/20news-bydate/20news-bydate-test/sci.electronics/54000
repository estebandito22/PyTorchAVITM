They've been out of busines for years.

Not any more.  About 2 years ago they all closed.
When Ramco/Electronics city closed, it took weeks and many
dumpsters to clear everything out (so I heard).
There are a few places that sell connectors and phone wires,
but no chips, capacitors or discrete stuff.

Sylvan/Wellington is still on Broadway and Canal, but they're
not cheap, and not surplus.  It's mostly a TV repairman's store.
