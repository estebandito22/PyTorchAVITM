Inkjet and Bubblejet printers are the same tech.  "Bubblejet" was trademarked
by Cannon and inkjet was by HP I belive.  I have seen both, and own a 
"bubblejet" (a Apple StyleWriter which has a cannon engine) with a 360 dpi
rated output.  The output is very good with quality paper, which is
very importaint.  Cheap paper gives bad results.  I use sealed paper and
the only differenc is that the ink is less dark than toner (I compaire
to the Apple Personal LaserWriter NTX), but then again the difference
is $300 to $1500 so....
