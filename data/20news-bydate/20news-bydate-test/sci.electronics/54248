What are people's opinions about laser detectors?  Escort makes a
laser detector, the Passport 1000, and claims it works fine.  However,
I've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you
are lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in
front of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your
detector.  Otherwise it won't work.  Regular radar, of course, travels
in all directions; hence it is more detectable.  Any comments?

Escort has a deal (till the end of April, I think), where if you buy
their wideband (Passport 3200 - X, K, Ka) and laser detectors, you'll
save $60 off of buying them separately.  In this case, the addition of
the laser detector over the Passport 3200 is only $40 (i.e. Passport
1000 normally costs $100).
