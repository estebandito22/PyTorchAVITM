We use it as starting fluid for jet ski's. The fact that its a lubricant 
works very well since jet ski's are 2 cycle. It also helps when a ski
floods with water because we clean the spark plus with the stuff.


OB sci.electronics:


I have an office/studio in my garage with a phone in it. Our wireless phone
has a page feature where you can make the phone or hand set ring to get
the attention of the other person. Is there a simple circuit that I can use
over the second pair of wires (or the first pair) to emulate this effect
with the phone in the garage? (ie push a button to make the phone ring in the
house or push a button to make it ring in the garage.)



Thanks


Xavier
