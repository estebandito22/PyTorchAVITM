Accelerometers are not cheap, mainly because the outputs are fairly linear 
with respect to acceleration.  You don't say what the range of acceleration 
you want to measure is, and there are other ways in which to measure it 
other than using an accelerometer.  Additional information would be helpful 
to anyone who may respond.

Call, if you wish.
