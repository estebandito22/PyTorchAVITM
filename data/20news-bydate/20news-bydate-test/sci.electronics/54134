	I wrote a commercial program called GAME-MAKER (can you guess what
it does).  What we do is have a document protect (answer Question on page x, 
line y), which is a real pain.  We also allow the user to register by sending
in a card, and computing a # based on their name.  The system works in that
we've gotten lots of registration cards.
	I hear that the program has been cracked though.  Someone two people 
actually called up my support--one with a question, the other wanting to
buy our graphics libraries (right!).  Anyway if anyone wants to help me
catch a cracker and has the cracked version, mail me.  I won't accuse
you (unless you're the cracker of course).
