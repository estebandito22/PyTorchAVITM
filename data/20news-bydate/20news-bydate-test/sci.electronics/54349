For some time I've been thinking about the possiblity of starting a group
where scientific articles can be published (or perhaps just summaries).
Possible advantages would be:
* Free disribution
* Fast acceptance
* Online discussion between authers and readers

This would be possible with one group with a moderator for publishing the
articles and one perhaps without for discussion.

The best thing would be if all the articles would be in a standard format which
would make it possible to print or view the documents camera ready. Perhaps
Postscript or Rich Text Format?

But how do you start a new group? Anyone interrested?
