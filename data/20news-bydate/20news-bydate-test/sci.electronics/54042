I strongly disagree. I think most pirating is done by amateurs, who won't
copy the program if "diskcopy" can't do it.
If you're talking a 20% max goal of pirated copies, I bet that anything that
will beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, will
suffice.
I hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online - *not*
because I want to copy the program, but because its usually faster and
and convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find.

Off deeper end-> Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
backup copy? Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk,
so you are left with the originals as your backups. I think its a waste
of time, space, and money, as well as it makes it to tempting to "lend"
out the backups. 


No flames intended - just my thoughts.
