I need to make a power supply that can take input from a 
cigarette lighter in a car (12v dc) and drive 7.5 volts
at up to 3.0 amps. I know enough to know that a simple
voltage divider with two resistors won't do it right. Can
such a thing be made from Radio-Shack-able parts without
too much difficulty?

p.s. I've looked for premade things like this at radio shack but
none of it seems to go any higher than about 800mA.
