This is just basicly right. The connections that cannot handle touchtone dialing is very few. I would estimate a couple of percents and if you are in a bigger
town, there is none that cannot handle tone dialing.
And regarding our swedish dialing system (a rather screwd up system), that does
just apply to pulsdialing. Not to touchtone.
Btw; Norway is even more interesting. They got both system! So you need different phones depending on where in the country you live.
