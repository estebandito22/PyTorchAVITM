   I would also be interested in the application here.  I work with a Dance and
   Technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot
   wide stage from 50 feet away.


Could make for some interesting choreography... light and sound could be 
controlled directly by the position of a dancer on stage, or by the number
of dancers on stage. Neat.

You could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage!

Can you tell us more about what you're doing? Sounds like a very cool program.
