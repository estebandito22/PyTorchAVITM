Subject: Self-destructing copy protection on VHS tape?

Hi folks,

I borrowed a VHS tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying
that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the
original. I found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different
processes. However, I've never seen this tape being sold anywhere so I don't 
want to take the chance even it's small.

Anyone has experience in this kind of self-destructing video tapes?

Thanks in advance.
