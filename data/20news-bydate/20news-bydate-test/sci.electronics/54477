Does anyone have recommendations on whether a smart data I/O (print spooler,
digital sampling, etc.) would be better implemented with a DMA chip or a
dedicated microcontroller?  Essentially what I am trying to decide is the best
way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a
memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use
by the smart data I/O.
 
Which DMA or microcontroller chip would be best to use?  Fast, cheap, and easy
to obtain would be nice, but I won't limit my choices to only those that fit
those characteristics.  Even an 8086/8088 (under $5) would do what I want,
but I am sure there is a better alternative -- like a microcontroller with
onchip (E)EPROM.
 
So I essentially want to hear about all DMA and microcontrollers that are simple
to interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring a
few I/O lines.
