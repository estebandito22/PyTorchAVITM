I have a DeskJet 500 and I thought I'd give a little info.  The DeskJet 500 WILL
do landscape mode like the HP LaserJets.  I can't say if other inkjets do
though.  Also the DeskJet can do downloadable fonts ONLY if you buy a softfont
memory cart for it.  OH!  You said the LaserJet can rotate a graphic image!
Hmmmmm!  The DeskJet can only rotate text.  Nevermind!
