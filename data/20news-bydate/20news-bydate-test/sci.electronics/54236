I am interested in finding a supplier for an array of leds on material which is
transparent when nothing is lit.

I'm not quite sure what LCD screens are like away from the laptop but I would 
guess they are not too clear.

An ideal item would be an LED array for which each LED is about 1/2" square.  
(Yes very course)  This is for distance viewing, but on a window.

Any pointers of suggestions would be much appreciated.
