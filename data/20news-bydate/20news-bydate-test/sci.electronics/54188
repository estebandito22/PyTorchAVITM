Hi, folks out there !

I don't know whether I am in the right newsgroup, but I have a question.

If I am completely wrong here in this group, could you mail me the right name  
of the correct newsgroup ?

A friend of mine is studying electronics at the Technical University in  
Karlsruhe/Germany since one year.

He wants to know whether there are possibilities to study audio control  
engineering in the U.S.A. .

Does anybody know how to get information about these studies in the U.S.A. ?
Could you send me information like (e-mail)adresses of the universities,  
"quality" of these studies, and so on ?

Is it possible to e-mail the universities directly to get information ?

Do the universities send information via e-mail ?

Please could you answer via e-mail, because I don't read this newsgroup  
regularly.


Thanks in advance.
