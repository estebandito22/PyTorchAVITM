>What is Pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments?

    Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment
(octave, 1/3 octave, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-20kHz octave has the same
amount of noise power as the 10Hz-20Hz octave.
    White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment
(Hz, kHz, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-10.1kHz band has the same amount of
noise power as the 10Hz-110Hz band (both bands are 100Hz wide).
    Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a -3db/octave
filter (usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs).
Note: you can't get -3db/octave by using half a -6db/octave network 
:-(
    Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements.
It shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave-related bands)
as a flat line across the bands.
