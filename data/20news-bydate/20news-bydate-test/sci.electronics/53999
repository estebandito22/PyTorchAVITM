Two or three years ago I saw a report on TV about a company that had 
developed a method of making solar cells on a flexible substrate. My
failing memory has convinced me it was some flexible metal. I now have
an application that requires a flexible solar cell and was hoping someone
out in netland knows something about this company or a similar product.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
