Can some kind soul provide me with information on LDRs that contain an
onboard light-source, in a totally integrated and light-shielded unit.

I have seen a VTL5C LDR in some schematics.  So who are the manufacturers
of these devices, and what are the different types.

Thanks very much in advance,
Jim.
