         A while ago I saw some translucent pads, about 6"x8" or so that 
could be plugged into (something) and they would glow.  One was red, 
another green, another blue.  Interresting.  I was wondering if anyone 
would have a feed on anything of this nature, and of the price.
   oh, the pads were rubber-like and were floppy like, about 1cm thick or 
so.
 
                Thanks.
