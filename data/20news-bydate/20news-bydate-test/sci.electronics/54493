I was a bit surprised that the manual for my Fluke-87 multimeter
suggests applying WD-40 to the test lead sockets, especially the
current range socket.  The intention is to prevent the
test-lead-is-in-the-wrong-scocket beeper from going off when there
is no test lead in that socket.

The manual is a bit vague, but I think I'd apply the WD-40 to a
swab, then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directly
from the can.

Speaking of said meters:  I compared the 87 against the 8060A that
I've had on my bench for almost 11 years.  It has been five years
since the 8060A has been calibrated.  On the DC scale, they agree
within .01 mV.  AC scale is within about .1 mV.  The 87 would be
just about the perfect portable meter if it had the dB scale; I
didn't feel it was worth the extra $100 for a second 8060 since I
don't use dB all that much in my work.
