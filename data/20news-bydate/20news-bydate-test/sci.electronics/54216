I'm wondering if I can tote my American touch tone phone around with me
to Sweden and Germany.  It's DC powered, and I can buy a special adapter
for that in Europe.  The question is if the general electronics work
the same.  I can buy a different wall plug and refit it (I'm sure I'd
have to), but would that do the trick?

Thanks,
Hugo
