Hi,
	Just a quick question.  What standard lab solvents can be used to
clean electronic equipment and components safely (ie not corrode, dissolve,
short-out, etc the equipment)?
	water?	:-)
	methanol?
	CCl4?
	etc?
I am not an electronics type (surprise, surprise), and I want to avoid using
freons.

Thanks,		Adrian
