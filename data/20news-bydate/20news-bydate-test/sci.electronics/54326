  Well, Bertil, you might laugh, but in many places here in Austria, there are
no wall jacks yet, either - just wires sticking out of the wall (and put into
a closed, often sealed, box) :-)
  As far as I remember from Germany, it is a nicely mixed situation - somebody
had wires sticking, somebody had jacks...
  On the other hand, everywhere in Bohemia I have seen wall jacks, and never
seen just wires sticking out of the wall... And I thought Slovakia was the
same case. Well...

  "How much do Scandinavians know about the rest of Europe?? :-))"
