    Hello, I'm looking for information on Alphanumeric pagers 
and *how* the data is sent from the paging transmitter and how 
I would go about building a device to decode the paging data 
(like my pager does) and feed it though an RS232 port.
    I'm planning on seperating different paging messages and 
different pagers in software to keep amount of hardware I need 
down....  Does anyone know what chips (Motorola?) are good for 
decoding Numeric and Alphanumeric paging data (and then stuffing
it down an RS232 port (basically any baud rate is fine!) ? 
    (I already have a radio reciever with headphone level 
output for the audio signal from the paging tower, but I'd be 
interested in anything you know about pagers, including the 
type of radio recievers they use!)
    Thanks in advance!
