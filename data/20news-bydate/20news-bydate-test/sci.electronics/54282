What kind of CSA/UL/FCC approval do $60+ mail-order PC computer
cases and power supplies have?  

Can I assume that the certification process for small-scale custom hardware
(ie digital/analog circuitry) is reduced, or even eliminated, if I use
such a case and (certified) power supply?

Also, assuming that I use a "certified" power supply, have I satisfied the
requirements of CSA/UL approval, and possibly FCC approval as well?
Do mail-order PC cases satisfy FCC certification?  Is FCC certification
even necessary for scientific (non-commercial/non-residential) use?
