The battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold.  The temperature
combined with self-discharge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of 
the battery.  I strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesn't
go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite
cooler.
