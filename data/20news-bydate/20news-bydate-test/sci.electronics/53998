Hi all,

I think the subject says it all - does anyone know how to take the rgb/h/vsync from a standard vga connector and record them on video tape??

Any help is appreciated!

WHY??  I have a program for the PC that I want to videotape so that I can show
people how the program works at a presentation I am giving.
