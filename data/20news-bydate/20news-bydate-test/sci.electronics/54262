I am looking for a text/reference that will include pinouts, 
description, and functionality for just about any IC made.
Does such a text exist?  Are there docs on the Internet that
reference IC's?  It would be a great idea if each major
IC manufacturer made available to the public an anonymous
FTP site with all it's data books in the form of text files.
(ala RFC style).  This would save time and money for the
IC manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to send
around the world via internet and since most users of
IC's
are found in the internet anyway.  

Are there any books available for purchase that reference
(as many as possible)?  Or am I going to be stuck obtaining
a zillion databooks from the manufacturers (those little
phonebook-type books that are obsoleted every couple years)

:-(
