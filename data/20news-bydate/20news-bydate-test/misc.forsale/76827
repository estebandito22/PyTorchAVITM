    I have a few 12" composite monochrome monitors for sale.  Magnovax Computer
Monitor 80, Model number BM7650 074B.  RCA type input for video only. (no
audio).  Power, Brightness and Contrast dials in front, V and H hold and
position controls on the back. Nice little monitor that can be used for 
PCs, Amigas, your VCR, security monitor.  Excellent condition. I am asking
for $40 plus shipping and COD (not to exceed $10) if applicable.
