	I've got 2 foot switches for sale.  They appear to be designed
for studio use (ie: they're very well built) - 1" in diameter, 6'
cord.  I'd like $15, but I'd also like to sell them, so make me an
offer.

	Also I just bought a new Ibanez guitar so I need to sell one
of my others.  It's a Kramer with passive EMG pickups (2 single, one
double).  These pickups sound GREAT and are whisper-quiet.  I'd like
to get $250 for it.
