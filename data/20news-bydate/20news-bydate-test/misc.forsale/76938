I need to sell two pairs of BladeRunner in-line skates (we don't use them).
One is size 9 and one is size 12.  They are less than a year old and were
used very little, generally in the Corridor.  They are in very good
condition.

They sell at Lechmere for $99.98 (we still have the boxes, if you want
them) and we'd like to get $85/OBO for them.  Please respond by
e-mail.
