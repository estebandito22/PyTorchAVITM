Hi All

I have a Korg DVP-1 for sale for $300.00 + shipping.  For those who've not
had the pleasure:

It is a MIDI controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice
processor.  What can it do with your voice?  It can pitch-shift it (change the
notes you sing).  It can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one
time).  It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what
you say alone and intelligible.  This works well for a "computerized" sounding
singer, or robot voice.  For those of you who just thought about that, yes -
you can do the voices from Robo-Cop, and the old ELO lead-ins with it, and yes -
I'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically.  For an input,
it takes both: XLR (3-prong mic) and 1/4" cables.  For output, you can have
a combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the
original signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired).  It has preset
setups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences.  It has a couple
of light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly.  Even when we
don't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio.
The manual is included.  I never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but
it has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten.
