I recently purchased an IBM monochrome vga monitor from Mike Damico. The
monitor arrived but it was missing it's power cable. Mike's address is
apparently not a proper address because mail can't reach it. If anyone
knows how to contact Mike and could help me find him I would appreciate it.
I am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor
but it would be a lot more useful to me if I had the cord as well.
