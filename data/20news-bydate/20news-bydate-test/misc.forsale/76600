I said
>Cipher tape drives				$10.00 
what a SILLY boy i was, now i have zillions of messages like
"does that include shipping" 		
"is it scsi"
"what rom version is it"
"will it work on a maximegalon gargantuabrain 9000"
ok, the deal is this - if you live in the twin cities, email me, and set
up a time, sure, you can drop round and grab one for a tenner.
Else
Min order $20 (2 drives) + shipping. No guarantees they are good for
any purpose at all (they look newish & clean), no technical
negotiations. They are model 525 floppytape, part # 960273-639
revision D. 17 pin floppy style connector on the back
Else
They go in the bin - life is too short for extended negotiations over
$10 items :-)
cheers
Mike.
