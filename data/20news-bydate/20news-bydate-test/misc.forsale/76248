I have a stack of records LP 33 that are from the early sixtys to mid seventys
with groups like the Beatles, Cream, Woodstock (triple album) etc etc. that I
would like to get rid of.  I would be willing to sell one or all for whatever
resonable offer.  Some albums still have the original wrapper and price tag.
I would like to get around $5 for each or you can call and make offer on the
lot.  I could list them all but I'd be typing forever.
           call (408) 296-4444
