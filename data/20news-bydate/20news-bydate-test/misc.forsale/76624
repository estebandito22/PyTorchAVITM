I'm selling an Adaptec 1640 SCSI controller card.  I works with Microchannel
machines only.  The data transfer rate is very fast (I get about 3meg/sec with
my SCSI hard drive), and that's with relatively slow 100ns RAM on a card.  It's
a SCSI-2 true bus mastering/DMA device, and goes for around $329 bought new. 
I'm including the new EZ-SCSI software for speedy Win 3.1 performance and easy
configuration.
I'm selling it for $225, and I'll pay the COD shipping.

Please email me directly, and either give me your phone # with your offer, or
I'll respond with mine.  I hope we can both benefit from the sale of this
Microchannel device; it's a great product!
