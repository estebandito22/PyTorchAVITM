I am currently searching for old video tapes of music groups of the early
80's to the late 80's.  At first I requested VHS formats, but now i'm accepting
either VHS, 8MM, OR BETA.  The type of format i'm interested in are the
type that most nite clubs or trendy clothing stores play.  If you do have any
of these tapes just send me a reply with a few groups listed, i'll reply back
if the groups listed are the type i'm searching for.  I'll gladly pay you what
they are worth or trade for other movie or music videos, thanks.

Tom.
