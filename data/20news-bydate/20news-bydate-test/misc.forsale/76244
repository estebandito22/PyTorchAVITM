I am looking for a copy of the first World Wrestling Federation album in
Record format.  Will pay $10 for a good condition record and original
album jacket and inserts.  The album I am looking for has a picture of
a bunch of the wrestlers ina recording studio front and back with the
good guy wrestlers and the bad guy wrestlers making faces at each other.
Songs include 'Land of a thousand dances" or something like that.

Please email me here at hsano@cs.ulowell.edu  same account that appears
