I've got 2 sets of sample cd's for sale

set one (2cd's)-geared towards house/techno/pop and rap

The 1st cd is all drum loops and drum sounds over 1500 of them
The second contains analog synths, basses, bass loops,  wavestations, vox
loops and much much more. 

The second set-

A variety of different sounds from new age to rock etc... kind of a
sampler cd..(pardon the pun)

Both have never been used and I can supply a list of categories for the
sounds if someone is seriously interested.

I'd like 130 for all three as they were $200ish new...
