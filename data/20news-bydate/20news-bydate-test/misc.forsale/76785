As the title says. I would like to sell my Star LV2010 9 pin printer.
Its a narrow colum dot matrix, supports both parallel and serial
interfacing, prints at 200 characters per second, has a 16K buffer, 
and is very dependable...

Drop some mail if your interested in it. $55 Plus shipping get the
printer, and 6 extra srink-wraped ribbons, parallel connection
cable, power cord, manual, and ONE sheet of paper (smile)...

Roy
