	Hello,

		I have two 3b1s for sale. One of them is a 1MB RAM
	and the other one is a 2MB RAM system. They are both running
	the 3.51m version and I have loaded lots of software on them
	from the network like gcc, emacs, tex/latex and so on. I am
	asking $500 for the 1MB, and $650 for the 2MB model or best 
	offer.
