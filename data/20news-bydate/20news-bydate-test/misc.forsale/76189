   Is there anyone out there with a copy of the driver for Turtle
Beach's Samplevision program that allows you to use a Always Tech
IN-2000 SCSI card to do SMDI dumps between your PC and your
Peavey DPM-SP / SX / SX2 ???  

   This is normally only available directly from Turtle Beach but I
was just wondering if there was someone who got it and couldn't
find a use for it..

   If you have a copy let me know!
