CASIO/B.O.S.S. SF-8000 Organizer (64K) with CasioLink Hardware/Software

Nice personal organizer that is in excellent shape.  It allows you to
store phone numbers/addresses (do searches, etc), business cards info,
schedules, and calender and also provides home/work time and calculator.
Also has password protection and alarms.  Nice 6 line LCD screen and
mini QWERTY keyboard.  Comes with CasioLink that lets you interface it with
your computer (Mac/IBM) and transmit/receive data (all forms).  I have
the software for the macintosh that runs it.  Nifty tool for people on the
go.  If you are interested, please email an offer.  Thanks. I have 
necessary instruction manuals and all cables.  Thanks.
