All are gone except 3 and 5.  Go ahead - make me an offer I can't refuse!

    1. Large padded Cordura bag  SORRY, SOLD, AWAITING CHECK.
    2. Small "Nikon" shoulder bag. SORRY, GONE.

    3. Small "Nikon"* belt pouch.  Khaki.  Similar to an
	 Army ammo pouch - belt clips, etc.  Holds flash or small
	 zoom, lens cleaner, etc. Great for your extra lens when you
	 don't want to tote a shoulder bag.  I think it can hold a
	 small Walkman and some tapes.  $5. + $1. postage.

    4. Domke belt pouch ... SORRY, GONE.

    5. Coast camera bag - tan, brown strap/trim.  Main and front pocket,
	10"x9x4.5 and 10x6.5x1.5 respectively. Can hold AF slr with small zoom
	plus flash or even an 8mm or compact-VHS video camcorder! Material
	looks like Gore-Tex but I don't think it is. I think it can
	also hold your portable CD player with a bunch of discs, headphones,
	AC, etc. $15. + $3. postage.

TERMS:  Payment in advance by money order/bank check, or cash.
