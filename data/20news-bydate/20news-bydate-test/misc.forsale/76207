Greetings netters,
	I have a Seagate 3144 130MB IDE drive forsale.  I bought it yesterday
and have been able to come across a 215MB that I am going to buy, but I 
need to sell this one.  I guarantee that it will work.  There is still a
transferable warranty I believe.  It was only used as a boot drive, not a
server (source) drive.  I just want my money back out of it...$180.  Thanks
a lot and offers appreciated.  Dave 317-495-5978  kari@sage.cc.purdue.edu
