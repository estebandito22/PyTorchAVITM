	A friend of mine has a complete set of AIX-PS/2 1.2 software
	and manuals for sale. (NEW) (all on 1.44 Meg floppies)
	including:

		Base OS
		Development tools (including C Compiler)
		Administration extensions
		X Windows / Motif
		TCP/IP 
		PC simulator (DOS Merge)
		etc. etc.....

	(This software requires a PS/2 with 386 processor or higher, 
	ample disk space and memory :-) it can coexist with dos and 
	OS/2 on the same machine, and selectively booted at startup.)

	If you are interested email me your offer and I will pass
	it along. Keep in mind that the manuals and software fill 
	up a 12x12x18 box so shipping is a consideration.

	(Please include this message for reference)
