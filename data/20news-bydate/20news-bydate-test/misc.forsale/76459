I have a Practical Peripherals 9600sa (External) modem for sale.
It's been used less than 1 year and has a lifetime warranty. I've
never had a problem connecting to any site, something I can't say
for the noname or third tier modems. Original box and manuals.

$150 (firm) Includes shipping anywhere in the Continental US.
