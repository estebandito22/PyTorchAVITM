I have a Sherwood stereo receiver which I received as a gift, and would
like to sell, as I already own a system.  It is the Sherwood model RX-4010R
It is brand new, still factory sealed.  This is a high quality surround-
sound amp ( 160 Watts, 250 Watts Dynamic Headroom Power ), very highly
rated by Consumer Reports ( March, 1993 ).  Has 4 audio inputs, and Pre-amp
and Main-amp connection jacks for added flexibility.  Includes 2-year
factory warranty.  Comes with remote. 

Asking $210
