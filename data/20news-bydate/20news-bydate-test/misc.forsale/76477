	Heay bud, get a life in the real world.... Do you still play with your Atari
with the paddles? Geez man,  open your eyes on the technoledgy of today...

I have been quoted a price from a local dealer friend of mine, that I could get a 
Motherboard (386DX/33 with 64K cache, with 1 meg base ram.) for $285 !!

	Here is some friendly advice, go to your favorite book store (Walden Book's)
and pick up a Computer Shoppers Guide...

	You think that was aa good price wait till you see some of the OTHER goodies they sell
