CAD Setup For Sale:

G486PLB Local Bus Motherboard
  Can use up to 32MB of SIMMS (256k/1M/4M)
  9 expansion slots (8 16-bit slots, 1 32-bit slot)
  Weitek 4167 co-processor socket

33 Mhz Intel CPU

33 Mhz Weitek 4167 Math Co-processor

G-Host4000 Local Bus ET4000 Video Card
  Based on Tseng Labs' ET4000 chip design
  Supports resolutions up to 1280x1024 interlaced or non-interlaced
  Uses RAMDAC to allow up to 32k colors in 800x600, 65k colors in 640x480
  Register level compatible with CGA, EGA, VGA, MDA
  Software drivers available for 1-2-3, Symphony, Autocad, Autoshade,
   Windows, Wordperfect, VESA and 8514/A Emulation
  also contained on the card:
    Local Bus IDE controller
    Floppy Disk controller
    Two fully configuarable serial ports
    1 Parallel port
    1 Game port

  I used this setup to run AutoCad and 3D Studio.  The combination of
 Local Bus and the Weitek co-processor made for VERY fast CAD and modeling
 work.  The Weitek coprocessor can cut 3D Studio render times in half and
 sometimes more.  It also increases redraws and regens when modeling in
 both 3D Studio and Autocad.  Everything is less than a year old.  I am
 asking $950.00 + shipping for the whole package.  Please respond via email.
 Thanks.
