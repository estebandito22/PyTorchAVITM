This unit has been sold. Thank you for your replies!

There is another oven available for those still interested. My mother
decided to sell her spare. Same price, $50.00 to the first taker.

Her's is strictly microwave, no convection, and is in equally good
condition. Same size as our's, approximately 4-5 cubic feet.

Let me know!
