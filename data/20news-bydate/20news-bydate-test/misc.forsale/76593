*********************Word Perfect V2.1 for the Mac*********************


I have a brand new copy of Word Perfect 2.1.  It is the latest release,   $100
it has not been used and is still in shrink wrap.  It is a student
version so it is not upgradable to a newer version.  It sells for $250+
I would like to get $100 for it.
