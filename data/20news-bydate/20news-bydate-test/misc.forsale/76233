I'mposting this for my emplyer who doesn't have net access, (but you can reply
here, and I'll get the message to him.

My boss is looking for two books on the group Mamas and Papas

Papa John  by John Phillips
California Dreaming - (he told me who wrote it, but I don't remember)

He'd prefer hardcover, but paperback will do.

If you have these and are willing to sell, e-mail me here, and I'll pass the me
ssage along.

Thank you

Scott Wilson
