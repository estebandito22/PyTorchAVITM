	Here is your chance to have a full UNIX System at a small cost:

	I have a full set of Unix system for the AT&T 6300+ for sale.
	It is version 2.5 (The latest as far as I know) and 
	includes all the software (1.2Meg 5.25" floppies) and 
	Manuals for:
		- Base OS
		- Development tools (C compilers etc...)
		- Dos Merge (Simultask)
		- etc.

	(I beleive the software requires a 6300+ and will not work on
	any other machine)

	I also have a few AT&T 6300 and + manuals including the System 
	Programmers Guide if anyone is interested.

	Drop me a line with your offer if you are interested.

	(Please include this message for reference)
