	I have a '81 DATSUN 210 HATCHBAK forsale:

	It's a Blue Datsun
	Two doors (three, since it's a hatchback)
	69,900 miles
	Automatic
	Very good condition (I hate to sell it, but Phila insurance is
			     outrageous; I also don't need a car right now)
	I am asking $800 or BO

call Ron at 215-222-6933	or email: perrault@a.chem.upenn.edu
