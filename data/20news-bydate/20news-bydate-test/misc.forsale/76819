******* LOWERED PRICES *******

	I have the following IBM hardware forsale

	ATI VgaWonderXl24 -  This is a great card, it supports 1024x768 256
 colors, 800x600 32k colors, and 640x480 16 million colors.  I found that it
 also speed up windows considerably.  I'm asking $90 o.b.o. for this card.


	I also have 2 2400 internal baud modems.  I have Docs for both but I 
 don't have the original boxes.  Both work fine and I'd like to get $20 each or
 $35 for both .

	BackUPS 400 - Backup power supply that allows CPU and Monitor to 
continue to operate up to 30 minutes in event of power failure. Asking $50.

	Please e-mail all replies to jth@bach.udel.edu
	Thanks,
	Jay
