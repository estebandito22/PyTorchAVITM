Turbo boost is necessary if a turboed car.
Fuel reserve warning.
Coolant level warning.

It would also be nice to have a gauge that would cycle across the different
sensors in the FI system such as O2 sensor, altitude, Air Flow...

I'd love to get Tranny and diff.
Brake temp would be great...

And a BIG ASS tach.  :)
