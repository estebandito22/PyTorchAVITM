Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos? (I'm
not talking about Bronco II's, I'm referring to the Broncos that began
production in 1978 based on the F-150 chassis I believe)

I need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from all
models, how easily can that be done. Also, what kind of price range
should I be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) I'm in college right
now, and would like a Jeep. Unfortunately, I've got a bit of a ride to
school, and I need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in
the spring/fall. I think that the Bronco (with the removable fiberglass)
would be a better (read "bigger") choice than a CJ-5 or CJ-7.

Even better: anybody in the Maryland/Virginia area interested in selling
one?
