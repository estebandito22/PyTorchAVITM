Yep, that's when I noticed it too. I stopped replacing the hood badge  
after the second or third one (at $12.00 each).

2002 drivers used to flash their headlight at each other in greeting. Try  
flashing your headlights at a 318i driver and see what kind of look you  
get. They usually check their radar detector...they think you're alerting  
them to a cop.
