	Just a quick, simple question really...

	How many wheels are affected by the emergency brake on an '86 Nissan
Maxima. I've heard that all four are affected, but this would seem unusual
to me. I thought the emergency brake on most cars only affected the rear
wheels. Also, how powerful is the emergency brake usually? Enough to lock
wheels at 30mph? Hmmmm... I just have to wonder about some of the things I
hear...
