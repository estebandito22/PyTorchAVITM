Talking about car alarms, there are certain cars in this country that are 
only insurable if they are fitted with a Vecta alarm. We're talking Coswoths
and Porsches and stuff. Just before they (the insurance companies) decided to 
make this move, they insisted that the car be fitted with a Scorpion alarm (
now they've changed to the Vecta)... so everyone who's spent $$$ on fitting 
the Scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the Vecta system.

Sad huh? :-(					...Shaz...
