   Before the S4 became the S4 it was called the 200 turbo quattro 20v.
   This model did come in a wagon, a very quick wagon.  Very rare also.

Being a satisfied Audi owner (-90 100 turbo quattro. my 4:th Audi) I
get the free VAG magazine. The latest issue presented a new S4 Avant
(wagon) with a 4.2 litre V8. I'd like one of these ;-)

Btw, this is my second quattro and my third turbo and I must say that
even in the summer, with dry roads, the quattros give so much extra in
road holding and balance that I hope I can afford them always.
