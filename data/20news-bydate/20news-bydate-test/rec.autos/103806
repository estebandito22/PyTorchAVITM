     I also experience this kinda problem in my 89 BMW 318. During cold
start ups, the clutch seems to be sticky and everytime i drive out, for
about 5km, the clutch seems to stick onto somewhere that if i depress
the clutch, the whole chassis moves along. But after preheating, it
becomes smooth again. I think that your suggestion of being some
humudity is right but there should be some remedy. I also found out that
my clutch is already thin but still alright for a couple grand more!
