Summary: Considering buying



	Having had my car die on me(engine fire, insurance agent said
it was probably totaled), I am in the market for a another vehicle.
I saw a Toronado that was within my expected price range and was
wondering if anybody could relate their experiences with me.

Namely:  1.  Does it have accceptable power(it has a 305 in it)?
	 2.  Does its being front wheel drive make maintenance difficult?
	 3.  One power window and the power seat do not work, are these
		expensive items to replace if I do the work myself?
	 4.  How long do the engines usually last( 90M+ now)?
	 5.  Any other experiences good or bad, and opinions.

Thanks
