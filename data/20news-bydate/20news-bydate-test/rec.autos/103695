Hello all,

I know that after market sunroofs may have left a bad taste in some of  
your mouths, but I am really interested in finding a "good" brand if one  
exists.  Please let me know if you have heard of any makers with a good
reputation (few failures, no leaks, that sort of thing) and whether or
not you have had first hand experience with that manufacturer.  Who is
generally regarded in the industry as the "best" (price no object) maker  
of power sunroofs?? 

--Steve
