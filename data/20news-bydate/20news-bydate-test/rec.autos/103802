We have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration. Let me ask 
a similar question from the aviation field. You must have seen images of prop 
planes with all cylinders exposed. I have seen up to 8 cylinders positioned 
radially in a circular fashion with the prop at the center of the circle. 
This arrangement always brings up a geometric dilemma. How can one crankshaft 
throw accomodate 8 rods or are the pistons displaced but not visible from the 
outside.
