 I am a little confused on all of the models of the 88-89 bonnevilles.
I have heard of the LE SE LSE SSE SSEI. Could someone tell me the
differences are far as features or performance. I am also curious to
know what the book value is for prefereably the 89 model. And how much
less than book value can you usually get them for. In other words how
much are they in demand this time of year. I have heard that the mid-spring
early summer is the best time to buy.
