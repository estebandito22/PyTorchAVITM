Since the wheel/tire is balanced off the car i.e. the lugnuts are
not normally involved, how would they do that? I would think that
since the lugs are so close to the center of rotation any slight
difference in weight between a normal lugnut and a locking one would
not have any noticable effect on the balance. I could be wrong, it *is*
