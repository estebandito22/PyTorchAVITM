Before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm,
let's go on the assumption that one is desired.  The question then remains,
which one?  I've owned a Hornet, and was satisfied, but not enough to get
another for my new car.  The Alpine has been highly recommended, but what about
Clifford and VSE's Derringer 2?  Any others?  I want all of the standard stuff;
door lock interface, starter kill, light flash, LED, valet mode, passive/active,
shock/motion sensor, etc...  Thanks for the advice!
