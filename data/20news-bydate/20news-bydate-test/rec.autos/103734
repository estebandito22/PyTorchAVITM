here we go again...
now these are just rumors.. so dont quote me.

New Integra supposedly wedge shaped again.  175 hp and all-wheel drive
in top models.  Then a variant called the zx-r comes later. (roadster?).

i think it gets unveiled at end of summer.

Nothing about an airbag was mentioned, but im sure it'll have one.
along with a nice hefty increase in sticker... ???
