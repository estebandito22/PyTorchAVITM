Hello again.

Anyone here done any tinting work.  What are the best brands out there?
How about applications...I heard there was a water based brand that s
you can move around, till it's just right, and you then let it dry like that.

Wisconsin or Chcago area, that does a decent job, fairly cheap. (college kid)

Thanks for all the info...

Ps.  What is the maximum legal tint limit.
