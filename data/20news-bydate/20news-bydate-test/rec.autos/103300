flat = 180 deg V = horizonatlly opposed

Usually, it also equals "boxer," however, I think the term is
traditionally reserved for 8's and 12's (and firing order matters).
This was talked about here in r.a many months back; I can't remember
the consensus.

Examples:

Ferrari's 512TR is a flat 12 boxer.
Porsche's 911 is a flat 6.
Subaru's Impreza is a flat 4.

Brian
