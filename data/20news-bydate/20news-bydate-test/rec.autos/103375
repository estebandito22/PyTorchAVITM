Yeah, it seems toyota has always had a problem with those 2.2's
and sound. I know the celicas with em were pretty noisey, and
the MR2s were no exception. Now, about large displacement 4s
with bad noise.. I have a 90 Grand Am H.O. quad 4, and it
sounds really good, almost like a larger 6.. Now, Toyota
is coming out with an all-new Celica next year and the Mr2...
well who knows..

Later-
Chris
