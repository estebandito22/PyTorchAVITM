Yeah, diesels are cleaner than petrol powered cars. They even have catalysts 
fitted to disels now! Oh and Citroen have even launched the 'First sports 
diesel car in the world'. Which is probably true if you assume if its for 
production purposes (Merc-Benz had a prototype which runs on diesel back in 
around 1968..... it did - and read this! - 200 MPH!!!)
