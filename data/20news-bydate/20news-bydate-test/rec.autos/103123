First off, the correct spelling of Nissan's luxury automobile division
is "Infiniti" not "Infinity."  I would also like to clear up the question
of what kind of engines power Lexus and Infiniti automobiles, since a
person had remarked in earlier posts that most Lexus and Infiniti models
had V6 engines, while at the same time saying that several of each
manufacturer used V8 engines.

Lexus:
  LS400- V8
  GS300- V6
  ES300- V6
  SC400- V8
  SC300- V6

Infiniti:
  Q45- V8
  J30- V6
  G20- inline 4 (I must admit that I cannot remeber for sure here)

I hope this helps.
