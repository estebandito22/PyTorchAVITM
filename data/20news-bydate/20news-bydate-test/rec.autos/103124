My ex-husband & I used to own Borgwards.  Haven't seen any for a long
time.  They were really good cars.  Does ayone out there know anything
about them now?  I heard they were being made in Mexico, but of course
they wouldn't be the original German - if that's even true.  When I've
been in Mexico I haven't seen any.  We loved ours, even tho' they were
ugly - they had names - one was Humphrey Borgward.
