I want to thank all the people that responded to my post
a few weeks ago about buying an '86 Chev Nova with over
100,000 mi.

I decided to buy the car and have had it for about a month.
I replaced the front brake pads and changed the oil.  So far
no problems have surfaced.

I received many suggestions and encouragement on this
purchase and figured a late "thank you" was better than none.

Thanks to all!

Jim
