In the EC, the Corrado VR6 is rated as 'best handling car this side of a 
968'. As it goes, I just read an article in 'Autocar & Motor' comparing the 
VR6 to a Ford Probe (later to be launched in the UK).... The VR6 is more powerful (even more so coz its 2.9 instead of 2.8 in the EC) and more fun to drive
etc etc... but the Probe has a slightly smoother engine (thanx Mazda MX6!)...

They sum it up as 'both cars are fast - the VR6 is a bit more exhilirating to 
drive but only if you're prepared to work harder'
