	Yup.  Radar detectors that detect Ka band will pick up photo radar
as it's reflected from some poor slob ahead of you that just got nailed.

	BTW, many photo radar installations in the southern U.S. became
targets for high-powered rifles, or had their lenses "decorated" with cow
flop, etc.  Not that I'm advocating destruction of public property, but you
get the picture....
