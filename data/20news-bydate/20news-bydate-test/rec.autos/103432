GM has always screwed the rest of the divisions in favor of the
Corvette. The current platform is no exception. The "detuned" Camaro and
Firebird is a load of crap to keep people from realizing that they can
buy one of these instead of a Corvette and save about $10,000.

I like the idea of an Impala SS, but if they really wanted to impress
me, they would throw in a big phat 454. Imagine the cops in their Taurus
police package 3.0 and 3.8 litres as they stare at your taillights...
