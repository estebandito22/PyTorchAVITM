I dont know about Saabs but whenever there is a 'long temr tset' in a magazine
they always say that tehy're are little annoying niggles which keep on occuring
every so often... I wouldn't expect that from such a 'quality' car.... why 
doesn't anything like this ever happen on BMWs? Maybe coz they're 'quality'
cars ;-)
