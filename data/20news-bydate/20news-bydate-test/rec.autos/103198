We were at a dealership today looking at buying a car and
the salesman was showing us something he was calling a
"buy back".  Is that a car that was fleeted and then
given back for the new model the next year?  If that
is so, how many miles is a good number to have on it
and are these types of cars generally a good buy?

Thanks,
Ellen
