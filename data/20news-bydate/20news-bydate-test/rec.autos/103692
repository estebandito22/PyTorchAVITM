Hi fellow auto enthusiasts!

Does anyone have any info on the new 4 valve per cylinder diesels Mercedes
is working on?  Any specs on outputs, engine size, will they be direct or 
indirect injection?,  etc. would be welcome.  From what I hear these should 
be out late this year, next year??

Thank you in advance for your replies!
