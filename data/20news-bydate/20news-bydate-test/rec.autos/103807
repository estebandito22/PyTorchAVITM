Hello everyone,
   I have an insurance question.

Allstate insurance

SITUATION: Person wrecks car. Car is drivable to dealer. Person 
reports accident (no other cars involved). Driver estimates damage cost 
exceedes cost of car. Insurance people claim car is "totalled" because of 
exceeding repair costs.
Person says "WWHHHAATTTT!!!! But I drove the car here!" and takes it to 
another place. Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the 
dealer.
One more hitch... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred 
in Pennsyvania.

QUESTION: Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this, 
now fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled?

Please respond via E-Mail if you think you know anything about this sort of 
thing.
