I agree with Gaia. Even though the Saturn has proved to be a very reliable car
so far, a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind.

In my opinion, getting the PowerTrain warranty is enough. In my case, that's be
cause; anything that needed repairing in the interior (sunroof, windows, doors,
 etc.) I could do myself. I just didn't want to mess with the engine and such.

Plus I think the extra 3 years of 24-hour RoadSide Assistance must be worthe so
meting. I opted for the 5 year plan for $375.
