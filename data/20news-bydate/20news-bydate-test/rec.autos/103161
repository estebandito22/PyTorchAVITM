If you had free reign to design your own instrument cluster, which
gauges would you choose to have beyond the basic set?

I consider the basic set to be:

	- tach

	- coolant temp (or cylinder head temp for air-cooled engines)
	- oil pressure
	- amps

	- speedo
	- fuel

others that are nice to have:

	- volts (maybe this should be in the basic set)
	- vacuum/boost

I can think of a few others, but what are your ideas and why?
