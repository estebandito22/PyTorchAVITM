QUESTION: what's your experience with car wash wax?

This is the liquid type of wax in bottles that you pour it in
water, sponge it on you car, hose it off, and dry it with cloth.
Many people have used it. It is very easy to work with and gives
seeminly the same visual results as that of paste type of wax.

But, does it last long? Does it have any negative effects to car
paint?

Can you forward your reply directly to my email id? Thanks.

James
