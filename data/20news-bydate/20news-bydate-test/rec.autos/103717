I'm new to this group and this may have been discussed already, in which case
my apologies, but...

I have a '92 Integra with an auto box. According to the manual the car has
a lock up torque converter, or something similar.

What is it, what does it do and how does it work?

(Excuse my ignorance).

Does anybody know?
