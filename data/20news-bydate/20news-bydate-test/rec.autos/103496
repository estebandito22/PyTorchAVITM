if you want to annoy geico, call them up...give fake name...but real car 
specs..get a quote and then tell them they are more expensive than your 
current state farm/allstate insurance.  they will still send you quote etc.
then you can tear up their quote and stuff it in the prepaid return 
envelope and mail it back to them.  actually they were $12 more than my current
state farm rates.
