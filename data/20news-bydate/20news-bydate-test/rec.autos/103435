Actually, I've had a bad habit of stuffing a whole bunch of other garbage
junk mail in along with whatever else into *anybody's* prepaid envelopes
until they almost burst.  I believe they pay postage by weight.

Anyways, don't tear up the quotes just yet...I sometimes use their
quotes or other insurance quotations as leverage to haggle for a
lower rate elsewhere.  Usually it works to *your* advantage if 
they are lower.
