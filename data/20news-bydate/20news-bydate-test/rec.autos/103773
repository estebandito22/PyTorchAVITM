The European version is called 200 SX and have a 1.8 liter engine with
turbo and have more power than the US version ( 169 HP ); it goes from
0 to 100 Km/h in 7.5 sec and have a top speed of 225 Km/h ( 140 miles/h ).
I just purchased one ( new ) and I am looking for a repair book. I could
not find one in FRANCE and GERMANY; does anybody knows where to find one ?
Is there one in the UK ?
Probabaly no use to look in the US as the 240 SX have here a different motor.
I am very pleased with the car and have no problem with it; but like to have
good technical documentation about the car I own.
