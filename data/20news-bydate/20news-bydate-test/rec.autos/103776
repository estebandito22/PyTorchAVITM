Eve'.

I am looking to buy 4 new p195-50r15 tires.. (R or HR). I don't
have much to spend, but I would like a tire that will LAST. Does
anyone have any experience with the following brands?

	Riken
	Falken	
	BFG	
	General	

There are others, but these I can find here for under $70.. Like
I said, I am mostly interested in threadwear then speed, since I
hardly get to drive them over 80 or 90 mph. Also, is it true that
"noone will give you warranty on such tires", according to
a tire dealer?

Finally, do HR tires last longer than R tires (threadwear again),
or is that strictly a speed factor?

Thanks for any replies..
