One of the reasons I sold my '92 Civic VX was the chattery-grabby clutch
although I din't notice it being any worse in humid weather, perhaps because
its always humid around here.  I was told by Honda that it has to do with
changing from asbestos to non-asbestos linings, which began around 1990.
Someone could make some good money selling the old-fashion variety if it's
legal to manufacture them these days.  My feeling is that since many other
car makers do not have this problem, that it's a poor design or engineering
problem on the part of Honda.  Three things to look out for on all Honda
products - clutch chatter, bad brake rotors, and rusty exhaust systems.
