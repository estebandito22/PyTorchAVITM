Ahhh yes, Andrew, we meet again...

...no, not 'stealing' the oil, just draining it as to leave me stranded.

>C'mon, you think a vandal'll do that?!

Let me guess, you're from Hudson Ohio??

>That's absolutely ridiculous!

Get out and see the world.


"IF" I were the vandal, and I really hated someone, maybe someone who knew
something about cars, of course I would look for ANY types of valves I could
undo.  Especially, special oil drain plugs, and radiator petcocks.

As well as putting bad things in the gas...

While I would never vandalize someone's car, IF I were to, it would probably
be the 'time bomb' approach, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks
that way...
