it hauls butt, handles nice, but is junk.  i drove a brand new one for a day
as a loaner.  the key was already rusting...seems they stamp their keys out
of pot-metal.  all the controls seemed really junk...clutch was heavy.
door locks, power buttons, sunroof controls etc.  seemed really cheap.
no way i would pay 24k for this baby.  no airbag either.  i also drove a svx
for a day...stickered at 30k, but going out the door for 21k...a much better
buy, imo.  although it is more of a sports touring coupe...roomy etc.
the corrado is more of a small sports car.  the ergonomics and leather in the
svx was twice as nice as the corrado's.  both had smooth strong engines.
