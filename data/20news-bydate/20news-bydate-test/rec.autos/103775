Can taking the car to a car wash hurt the car's finish?

And if so, is it better to hand wash it about once a month, or just take it 
to the car wash anyway?

Are detailing places worth the money?  if i do a good, careful job on washing
and waxing, is a detail place going to be worth it?

My views reflect Cornell's.  Sue them dry.
