Thanx Craig.... in addition to Craigs coments - and to clear up any 
further confusion.... the 200SX (of USA) was reffered to as a Silvia Turbo
in the UK.... performance figures of UK 200SX are:

			0-60: 6.4s
			Vmax: 142mph

Oh one more Q: you know that new Prelude VTEC? Well is there an auto version
in the USA? I've heard of them in Japan but not UK. Also, do you guys get 
auto Miatas?
