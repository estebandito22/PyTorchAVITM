Having read in the past about the fail-safe mechanisms on spacecraft, I had
assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function.  However I
always find disturbing the oxymoron of a "NO-OP" command that does something.
If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not
a "NO-OP" command.

Of course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has
nothing to do with jet propulsion.
