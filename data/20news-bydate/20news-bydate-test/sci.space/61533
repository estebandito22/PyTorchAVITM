Ejon Matejevic who was a full professor at Clarkson University, last
I heard,  developed the process for sticking Teflon to metals.

I don't think it was a NASA project, cuz i heard he held the patent
on it, and had made quite a bundle off it.

Anyone from Clarkson know the Exact story.  I never wanted to ask
him myself.
