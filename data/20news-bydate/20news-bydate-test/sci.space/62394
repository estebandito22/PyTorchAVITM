Gene Miya says that Henry will never go aloft in the Shuttle; the
payload bay isn't big enough for his chocolate chip cookies.

When Henry was here at Dryden, he was looking pretty covetously at the
SR-71s and the F-104s, even though they don't have much cookie space.
I guess he figured that he could manage for a short flight....
