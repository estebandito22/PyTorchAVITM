Are you talking about a single BATSE component, or
the whole thing?

You *could* propose a BATSE probe; launch two or three with ion
drive on various planetary trajectories... your resolution increaces
the more they're spaced apart. You could probably cheaply eject them
from the solar system with enough flybys and patience.

Things would start out slow, then slowly get better and better
resolution...
