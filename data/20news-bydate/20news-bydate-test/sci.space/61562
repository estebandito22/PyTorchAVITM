Hello, 
 
I am new to this news group, but I need some info.  I am 
currently doing a project for a class on the Internet.  I am
looking for good sources of information on space and astronomy,
more notably, our own solar system.  If anyone knows any good
sites where I can get information about this kinda stuff, please 
e-mail me at STK1663@VAX003.STOCKTON.EDU.  Thanx.
