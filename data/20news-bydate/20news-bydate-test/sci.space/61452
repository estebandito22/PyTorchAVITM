I do not understand what you are saying here.  What is improved, what 
is Significant, and what does this have to do with carrying more 
equipment on a servicing mission?  Also, as implied by other posters, why 
do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway?  Maybe you have 
something here, but could you please clarify it for us on the net?

From what I've heard, the motors are fine - it is one of the two 
sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix.  The 
motors and electronics are separate pieces of hardware.  I expect 
to be corrected if I'm wrong on this.
