Hardly.  The Keck telescope in Hawaii has taken its first pictures; they're
nearly as good as Hubble for a tiny fraction of the cost.

I believe that this orbiting space junk will be FAR brighter still;
more like the full moon.  The moon upsets deep-sky observation all
over the sky (and not just looking at it) because of scattered light.

This is a known problem, but of course two weeks out of every four are
OK.  What happens when this billboard circles every 90 minutes?  What
would be a good time then?
