The aperture door will be shut during reboost. Using the shuttle
means that there will be someone nearby to pry the door open again 
if it should stick.

It's clear that the "whiz kids" are not running the show. In any
case it's not prudent to stick a "slapped together" explosive device
on the end of a billion dollar asset that you'd like to see again.
(Wiseacres might say that a shuttle is a slapped-together explosive
device, but at least it's had some testing.)
