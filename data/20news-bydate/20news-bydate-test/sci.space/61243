I know it's only wishful thinking, with our current President,
but this is from last fall:

     "Is there life on Mars?  Maybe not now.  But there will be."
        -- Daniel S. Goldin, NASA Administrator, 24 August 1992

-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office

     "The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make
      anything."
        -- Edward John Phelps, American Diplomat/Lawyer (1825-1895)
