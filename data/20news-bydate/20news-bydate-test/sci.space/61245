Regarding drag free satellites, Joe Cain gives a good description of the concept.  It is however more than a concept.  The Navy's Triad satellite succesfully used drag free control.  Drag free control is an integral part of the Stanford Gravity Probe-B spacecraft, due to fly in 1999.  It is also part of the European STEP satellite.
