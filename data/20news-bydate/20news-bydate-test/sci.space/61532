Well,  you better not get the shuttle as your launch vehicle.

and most ELV's have too  far of a backlog for political messages.

If during the campaign season,  the candidates for president had
launched one,  right around now we'd  be getting a launch
for PEROT 92.

and if they had used the shuttle,  we'd be seeing launches
for NIXON now more then ever.
