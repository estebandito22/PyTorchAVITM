Yes, but that's because interstellar grains are very poor radiators, not
remotely black bodies.  As a consequence they are a lot warmer than the
"ambient".

When I was in graduate school, a long time ago, we used 10,000 deg K with
a DILUTION FACTOR of 10+4 for representative values of the radiant energy
background in the galaxy due to starlight.
