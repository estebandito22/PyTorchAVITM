That has sort of happened for real. Back in the 1920's travellers
in the Sudan would find strange cigar shaped designs on native huts.
When asked the locals would say it was a picture of the great omen
that appeared in the sky. This was LZ 53 a zepplin flying from Bulgaria
to German East Africa with supplies in 1917 (and back since it was fooled
by the British secret service.)
