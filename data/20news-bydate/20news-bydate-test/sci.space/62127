Here is a potentially dumb question: What prevents the martian landers
themselves from "polluting" the martian environment with earth based
critters? Is the long trip in cold radiation bathed space enough to
completely sterilize the landers?

I could imagine that a few teeny microbes could manage to get all the
way there unharmed, and then possibly thrive given the right
circumstances.
