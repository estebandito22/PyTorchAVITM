Correction, and some more info: The Kaliningrad that Mr. Larrison
writes about is indeed near Moscow. I've read that it may also be known by
the name Podlipk, and is a short distance from Zvezdny Gorodok (Star 
City) and the Cosmonaut Training Center there. I read that the Tsniimach
(Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building, est. 1961) 
Enterprise was also responsible for creating the NKIK (Ground Command and 
Measurement Complex) including the Kaliningrad Flight Control Center
which has controlled all Soviet/Russian manned spaceflights since its
completion in 1973. However, it appears to have been a part of the 
Ministry of General Machine Building which was not part of the military
(Ministry of Defense) but would have been a part of the military-industrial
complex.
