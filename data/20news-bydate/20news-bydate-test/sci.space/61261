I'd buy that for two reasons.  The tubes for TV's and radios (if you can
still find them) are usually 3x or more expensive than comparable transistors.

Also, ask any electric-guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer, and
they'll tell you tube-type, since tubes have lower distortion and noise
than transistors.  'Course, most of your electric guitar types just say
"Tubes sound better, dude." :-)

Also, transistors have the advantage in both waste-heat and energy-use,
mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes.
