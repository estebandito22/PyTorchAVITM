   If there is a "USA Today ftp site" could someone please post it to the 
   newsgroup so everyone will stop posting the "send it to me too" articles.
   I'm sure many people woulds like to know so why not just post it to the net
   rather than mailing hundreds of people. 

   Just a thought. 


    Thanks,    Ryan Robin.
