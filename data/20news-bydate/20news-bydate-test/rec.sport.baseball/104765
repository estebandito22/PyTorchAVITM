It is ironic that in any post that criticizes langauge ability, the critic
invariably makes a mistake himself ("english" is generally written "English".)

Oddly, I do not see that I have contested any of that. Perhaps you, with 
assuredly greater "english" ability can explain, in tiny words that I might
