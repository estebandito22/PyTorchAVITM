Tim Wallach can be explained with the rabbitball.  Deion can be explained
as "learning how to play the game".  I'm not betting that Deion will be able
to play as well as last year, but I think the odds of Deion playing as well
or better than he did last year are better than the odds of Otis Nixon
doing the same thing.  When you factor in defense, Otis was more valuable last
year.  But I'm not convinced he'll be more valuable this year, and especially
next year.
