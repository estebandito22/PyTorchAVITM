Was it just me, or did it look like Hirschbeck pointed to
the 3B umpire before calling that strike?  I thought that's
why Gant was asking for the appeal to the 1st base umpire;
he thought Hirschbeck had gotten checked-swing help from the wrong
umpire.

After Hirschbeck called for the pitch, but before the pitch was thrown,
Cox came onto the field.  It was obvious that he was trying to get time
called before the pitch, but no one was watching.

Your listing pretty much agreed with what I saw, with the aforementioned
addendums.  Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark.  Personally,
I was amazed that Gant didn't get ejected.  But that's why Cox did;
it's called protecting your players.

And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game,
all I can say is that you'd be making baseball history.  Even in
the worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators are
ejected, not everyone who comes onto the field.  And I'd have to 
say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game
 than what the Braves did Fri. night.

Anyhow, that's my last two cents on the subject, barring
outrageous postings.  I will try to keep my eyes open
for more incidents involving Hirschbeck. I think there will
be some with other teams as well.  I hope not.
