	Baltimore Baseblazers? Where the hell did you come up with that? The
Orioles are not a base-stealing team except for Anderson. Besides we would
never call them anything but the Baltimore Orioles. Why? The ballpark has
all these orthologically (spelling error?) correct BALTIMORE ORIOLES all
over the place. I bet you thought the bird is just an oriole. It's not. The
bird was named after Lord Baltimore when Maryland was founded. They're
called Baltimore Orioles. But the post is just a joke so why do I care what
a non-O's fan thinks of us? But I still wonder where Baseblazers came from.
San Diego Padres, now there's a name that needs to be changed. How is padre
being used? As "Father" ie priest or "father" ie parents?
