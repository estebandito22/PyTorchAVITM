How is that possible?  He was on the Albuquerque Leftturns last year.
How could you possibly know what team he would be on if Manny Lee was
on his team last year.  After all, Manny Lee wasn't on his team last year,
so it's complete, unfounded speculation to state that if he was on the
same team as Manny Lee last year, it would have been the team of the
Toronto Blue Jays.  Since he and Lee weren't on the same team, you
cannot possibly objectively state what team they would have been on
if they had both been on the same team.
