Er..yes.  If Manny Lee was on your team last year, your team would have been
the Toronto Blue Jays.

Again.  If Manny Lee was on your team last year your team would not have been
the Albuquerque Leftturns.  It would have been the Toronto Blue Jays.

That's the whole point isn't it?  Clemens didn't get a ring but Morris did.

Exactly.  And Morris was part of the team.  Would the Jays have won with 
Clemens?  We will never know.  But we do know that the Jays won with Morris.
So how could you possibly say that Clemens had a better year?  No pitcher
in baseball could have had a better year than Morris had last year.
