There is a correction to the note I posted for today's update:

This is how it read:
> NOTE: Saturday, April 20th's scores should be sent out by this coming Friday.
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Of course, last Saturday was April 17th. People who requested those scores
should receive them by Friday the 23rd. Thanks.
