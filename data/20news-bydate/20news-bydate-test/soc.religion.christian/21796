From the June newsletter of the Latin Liturgy Association:

There is a new e-mail discussion group: LATIN-L, a forum for people
interested in classical Latin, medieval Latin, Neo-Latin; the languages of
choice are Latin (of course) and whatever vulgar languages you feel
comfortable using.  Please be prepared to translate on request.  The field
is open -- name your topic!  In order to subscribe, BITNET users should
send an interactive message of the form "TELL LISTSERV@PSUVM SUB LATIN-L
[your name]".  INTERNET users should send a message (without a subject
line) to the address LISTSERV@PSUVM.PSU.EDU.  The message should read "SUB
LATIN-L [your name]".  Once subscribed, one may participate by sending
messages to LATIN-L@PSUVM or LATIN-L@PSUVM.PSU.EDU.
