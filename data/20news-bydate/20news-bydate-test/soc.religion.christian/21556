Hello, Brycen ?!
I'm a Norwegian journalist student - and also a Christian. Thanks for your 
testimony! But I want to ask you one question: What do you think of Heavy 
Metal music after you became a Christian? You know there are Christian bands 
like Barren Cross, Whitecross, Bloodgood and Stryper, that play that kind of 
music. I like some of it, I feel like it sometimes. Of course I listen to 
the lyrics too. I don't listen to any Christian band, but it's better than 
listening to secular music anyway. 
Hope you're still going strong - with Christ!!
