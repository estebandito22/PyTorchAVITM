What is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal
suffering?  If it is Biblical, please reference.

Here's my train of thought: If God is using the Earth to manufacture
heavenly beings, then it is logical that there would be a certain
yield, and a certain amount of waste.  The yield goes to Heaven, and
the waste is burned (destroyed) in Hell.  Why is it necessary to
punish the waste, rather than just destroy it?

Peace and joy,
