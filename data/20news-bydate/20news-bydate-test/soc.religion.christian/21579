Lines: 9

Seeing as how _The_Two_Babylons_ has been brought up again, it is time for
me to respond , once again, and say that this book is junk.  It is nothing
more that an anti-Catholic tract of the sort published ever since the there
were protestants.  Its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious.
