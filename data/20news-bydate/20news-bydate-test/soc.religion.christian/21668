[Someone asked about Biblical support for the image of Satan as
a fallen angel.  Rev 12:7-9 and Enoch have been cited.  --clh]

There is also a verse in Luke(?) that says He[Jesus] saw Satan fall
from Heaven.  It's something like that.  I don't have my Bible in
front of me or I would quote it directly, but it's a pretty obvious
reference to Satan's expulsion.

[I believe the reference is to Luke 10:18.  The context of the passage
makes it possible that Jesus is referring to Satan being defeated by
Jesus' mission, rather than a previous fall from heaven.  --clh]
