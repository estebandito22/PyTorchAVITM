Subject: the Imprecatory Psalms
Lines: 10

Paul Fortmann submitted a sermon by Peter Hammond on PRAYING FOR
JUSTICE that spoke of the positive value of the Imprecatory
(Cursing) Psalms.

In this connection, I recommend to the membership the book
REFLECTIONS ON THE PSALMS, by C S Lewis, with special reference to
the chapter on "Cursing in the Psalms."

 Yours,
 James Kiefer
