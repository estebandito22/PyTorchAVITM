That's the whole point, David.  As spirits separated from their bodies
and living in the spirit world, they cannot undergo the ordinance of
marriage, just as they cannot be baptized, since there is no physical
body to be baptized.  We perform these ordinances as proxies for them,
in their behalf.  Thanks for asking.  Brooks
