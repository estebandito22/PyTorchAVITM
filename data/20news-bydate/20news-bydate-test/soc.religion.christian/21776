Does anyone know whether the _Acta Sanctorum_, the huge multi-volume collection
of Roman Catholic hagiography produced by the Bollandists, has ever been
translated into English?  I'm working on the _Vita S. Dympnae_ and would love
to be able to check my own translation against somebody else's.  

Email replies preferred, unless this query turns out to be of general interest.
