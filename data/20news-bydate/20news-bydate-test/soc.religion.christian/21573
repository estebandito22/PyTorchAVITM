I would absolutly love to have the time and energy to do so. The
problem is to be totally fair I would have to go throught this type of
search on every issue I belive in.  I don't have the time, resources,
or ability to do what you ask.  Maybe you should pray that God gives
me the opportunity instead of simply discrediting me because I have
not been able to talk to every gay christian.

In Christ's Love,
Bryan
