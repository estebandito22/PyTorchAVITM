What is the proper way to dispose of old blessed palms?
I`ve have a bunch that I`ve been holding onto.  In addition,
my mom has been giving me her's.  I used to give them to my
uncle who would burn them (and leave the ashes to seep into the
ground).  Should I do the same?  Could I just bury them?  Could
I add them to my compost bin?

Thanks in advance.
