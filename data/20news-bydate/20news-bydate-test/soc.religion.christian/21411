I would add 4': our churches should accept homosexual orientation but hold all
people to certain standards of sexual behavior.  Promiscuity, abuse of power
relationships, harrassment, compulsivity are equally out of place in the lives
of homosexual as of heterosexual people.

Of course, this would bring up the dread shibboleth of homosexual marriage,
and we couldn't have that! :-)
