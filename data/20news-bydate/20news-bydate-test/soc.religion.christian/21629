I'm very grateful for scott's reflections on this oft-quoted phrase.  Could
someone please remind me of the Scriptural source for it?  (Rom. 12.9 doesn't
count, kids.)  The manner in which this little piece of conventional wisdom is
applied has, in my experience, been uniformly hateful and destructive.
