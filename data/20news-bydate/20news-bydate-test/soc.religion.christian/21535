Hello.
Hoping to net some netters
who are in the helping professions 
(counseling, psychology, psychiatry, social work, therapy etc.)
to network on some topics and consider
the possibility of a sci.counseling.christian type newsgroup
or list.

The integration of psychology and counseling and theology 
is a subject of great debate and one of particular interest
to me.

If you're out there, please lemme know.

Email me direct if you will so we can get to know one another
off the news.
