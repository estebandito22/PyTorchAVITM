Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one
another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with
gratitude in your hearts to God. 
Colossians 3:16

A reminder: These verses are from the New International Version. As with any
translation, faithfulness to the original Hebrew and Greek may vary from time
to time. If a verse sounds a little off occasionally, compare it with another
translation or with the original texts, if you are able to do so.

God Bless You,
