   searching out our deceased ancestors so that we can perform the
   ordinances -- such as baptism, confirmation, and marriage for time and
   eternity -- that are required for a person to obtain salvation through
   Christ and to live with Him through the eternities. These are people
   who may have not had the opportunity to know Christ in their lifetime,
   so we are making it possible for Christ's saving grace (I know there
   are thousands of interpretations of that phrase) to become fully
   effective for them if they allow it to do so on the other side.


This paragraph brought to mind a question.  How do you (Mormons) reconcile
the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection
people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?
