Please note that God commanded Adam to work before the fall:

"The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work
 it and take care of it." (Gen 2:15, NIV).  

Work was God's design from the beginning.

kind of labor imposed after the fall, but the statement as it
stands is misleading.  --clh]
