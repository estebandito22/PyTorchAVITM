     It bugs me when I see this kind of nonsense.

     First, there is no reasonable evidence linking Masonry to ancient
Egypt, or even that it existed prior to the late 14th century (and
there's nothing definitive before the 17th).

     Second, worship of Osiris is not, nor has it ever been, a part of
Masonic practice (we are strictly non-denominational).
