I invite them both (and other interested parties as well) to read my
comments on this verse of Scripture. To obtain them, send the
message GET CHOOSING BARABBAS to LISTSERV@ASUACAD.BITNET or to
LISTSERV@ASUVM.INRE.ASU.EDU. Putting it briefly, I think that the
significance of the demands of the Jerusalem crowd has usually been
greatly misunderstood, both by Christian and by anti-Christian
readers.

 Yours,
 James Kiefer

[You should send email to that address, with the contents of the
message being a single line containing the GET command.  The
subject line is apparently ignored, at least by ASUVM.  --clh]
