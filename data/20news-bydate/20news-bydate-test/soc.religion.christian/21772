You are quite confident that essences do not exist.  How do propose to
define beings?  Can a thing can be *one* without definition?  Can a being
have a definition and know essence?

What about properties?  Do beings have properties?  Does God have
properties?

Does numbers exist in reality as abstract entities or do we invent them?

See my post in alt.messianic about the possibilities of tri-theism from a
phiolosophical point of view.
