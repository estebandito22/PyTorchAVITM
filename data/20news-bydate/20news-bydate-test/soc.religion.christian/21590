Note the difference here. One is saying, if *Christ* disagrees with 
a Christian being gay, *Christ* can change that.

The other is saying, if *I* think being gay is wrong, that a Christian
cannot be gay, *I* need to tell them to change.


As Lois said, and as before her Paul wrote to the believers in Rome,
WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE ANOTHER'S SERVANT?
