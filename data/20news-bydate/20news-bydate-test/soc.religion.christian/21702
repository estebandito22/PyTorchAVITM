My girlfriend is a smoker. She has been addicted to it for quite some time.
She has been tried a couple of times, but then always get back to it. Her 
background is non-Christian, but she's interested in Christianity. I'm a
Christian and non-smoker.

I would like to collect any personal stories from Christians who managed to 
quit. I hope that this will encourage her to keep on trying. If anybody ever 
had a similar problem or knows a good book on it, pls reply by email. 

I appreciate any kinds of helps. Thanks a lot.
