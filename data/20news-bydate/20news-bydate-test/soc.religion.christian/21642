Several replies to my post have said that I should get to know  
Christian homosexuals before judging them.  I maintain that I was not  
judging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong.   I would like to  
look at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical  
evaluation of the people who responded to the side of Christianity  
and homosexuality being compatible (admitedly not all are homosexuals  
but I know that many are from their e-mail responces).  I don't  
normally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people, but  
since I have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point I will.

So far people have made wild assumptions, put me down because I don't  
have the resources of others, and even reverted to name calling.  If  
you don't think this is an acurate representation then those of you  
who are homosexual Christians show me the diffrence.

In Christ's Love,
Bryan
