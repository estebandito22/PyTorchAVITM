 Gaining entry into heaven cannot be done without first being cleansed by 
 the blood of Jesus. 
 Sin cannot dwell in heaven.  It is against the natural laws of God. 
 Being converted to christianity means being baptized by the Holy Spirit. 
 You cannot get to heaven by good works only. 
 Because of the union with the holy spirit, the man's behavior will change. 
 If there is true union he will not desire to be homosexual.  Fornication 
 and homosexuality will leave your life if you are truly baptized by the 
 holy spirit.  It's not to say that we don't stumble now and then.
