You should remember that in Adam's transgression, all men and women
sinned, as Paul wrote.  All of humanity cooperativley reblled against
God in Adma's sin, thus, all are subject to it, and the sin is
transmitted from generation to generation.

Andy, I did not write the above paragraph. I believe this is about the 3rd

the rest of humanity, but I did not cooperatively rebell against anything.
