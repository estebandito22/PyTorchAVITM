Since when did conservative, protestant, old-time religion believers get
an exclusive francise to christianity?  Christianity is, and always has
been, a diverse and contentious tradition, and this group reflects that
diversity.  I, fo one, am not ready to concede to _any_ group- be they
"liberal" or "conservative", catholic, protestant, or orthodox, charismatic
or not- the right to claim that they have _the truth_, and everyone else
is not "christian."
