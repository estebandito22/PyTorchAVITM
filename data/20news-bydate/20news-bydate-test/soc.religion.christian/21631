   In the Hebrew of Genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine.

	+ HE shall crush your head, and you shall bruise HIS heel.

   The Latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar.

I have yet to see an adequate explanation of St. Jerome's translation
of Genesis 3:15.  His Latin clearly uses the feminine, but I don't
know why, since the Hebrew is clearly masculine.  If anyone knows of a
scholarly treatment of this puzzle, I would appreciate hearing from
you.
