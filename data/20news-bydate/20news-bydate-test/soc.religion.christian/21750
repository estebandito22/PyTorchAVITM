Hi,
   What presentation package would you recommend for a Bible teacher?
   I've checked out Harwards Graphics for Windows. I think its more
suitable for sales people than for preachers or Bible teachers to present
an outline of a message.

   I'm looking for one that:
*  is great for overhead projector slides.
*  has or imports clip arts
*  works with Word for Windows or imports Word for Windows files.
*  works with inkjet printers
   If you know of any that meets part or all of the above, please let me know.
Please email your response as I don't keep up with the newsgroup.

Thanking you in advance,
James.
