It sounds like she has a problem.  She has a problem opening up to her
husband so she is lesbian.  WHAT? In a marrige, a couple is supposed
to open up to each other.  Because she didn't feel comfortable opening
up to her husband she gets a divorce and comes to the conclusion that
she is lesbian.  Before anyone gets maried they should make sure that
they would feel comfortable "open up the deepest part of her soul to
her husband".  "Sex, in her mind, is only a part of the whole
relationship."  Did she think it was diffrent with a man. That might
be her problem.

In Christ's Love,
Bryan
