I offer him four attempts.

First is an essay by me (largely indebted to Attempts Two and
Three), obtainable by sending the message GET TRINITY ANALOGY to
LISTSERV@ASUACAD.BITNET or to LISTSERV@ASUVM.INRE.ASU.EDU

Second is a couple of books by Dorothy L Sayers: a play called THE
ZEAL OF THY HOUSE, and a non-fiction book called THE MIND OF THE
MAKER.  The play can be found in the book FOUR SACRED PLAYS, and
also in various other collections, including one called RELIGIOUS
DRAMA (Meridian Books) and one called BEST PLAYS OF 1937.

Third is the book MERE CHRISTIANITY by C S Lewis, particularly the
last section, called "Beyond Personality".

Fourth is a book called THEOLOGY FOR BEGINNERS, by the Roman
Catholic writer Frank Sheed. I will say that I do not find Sheed's
approach altogether satisfying, but I know some persons whose minds
I respect who do.

 Yours,
 James Kiefer
