I'm looking for the following article:

	``The War Within: an Anatomy of Lust''
	Leadership 3 (1985), pp 30-48

I've looked in the libraries of 3 UK Bible Colleges, but none of them subscribe
to the Magazine (its a US publication, btw). If anyone has access to this
article and would be willing to post me a photocopy (I presume that copyright
restrictions will allow this?), please e-mail me. Thanks,
