Does anyone know of an English language edition that does not show the
verse (or even chapter) numbers.  I have always thought that such an
edition would be very useful - although hard to navigate around.

I have a Scots NT that doesn't show verse numbers, and it is great to
read, particularly longer narrative passages, but my Scots isn't quite
up to doing proper study from this edition - I tend to use it to get a
"feel" for a story, particularly in the gospels, and then use an
English edition to look for details.
