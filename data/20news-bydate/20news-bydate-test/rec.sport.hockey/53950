While watching the Penguins/Devils game last night, I saw the "slash" that
Barrasso took on the neck.  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate.  I think he was a Sabre, but I'm not positive.
Does anyone remember/know his name?  What has happened to him since?  What
about the player whose skate cut the goalie?  Name?  Info?  Has this ever
happened before in a hockey game?   

Thanks,

Carol
Go Pens!
