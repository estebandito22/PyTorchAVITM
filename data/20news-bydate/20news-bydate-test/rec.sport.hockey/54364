Absolute nonsense.  The decision that was made was Pocklington's.  He chose 
20 mill over Gretzky.  If Gretzky wasn't upset about not being able to win
a cup in LA then I submit that he wasn't worth the 20 mill.

How do you know what he thinks (or thought)?  The only "thought" that I
can see that you have revealed is your own.  You don't like Gretzky.
Big deal.

The real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty.  What
the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the
ref won't be fooled.  I can't imagine why anyone would expect someone like
Lemieux to change his game.  Why don't you pick on 1 dimensional over-rated
type like Hull and Salami.
