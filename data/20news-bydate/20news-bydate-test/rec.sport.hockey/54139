Teemu Selanne had 3 goals, Keith Tkachuk had one, and Luciano Borsato
scored a rare Jets shorthanded goal as the Jets held on to beat the
Canucks 5-4, and close the series to 2-1.  Trevor Linden and Pavel
Bure had two goals each for the Canucks in a losing cause.

Selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump, scoring two powerplay
goals, and one on a nice breakaway pass from Darrin Shannon.

Hard work paid off tonight for the Jets, and if the Jets continue to
exhibit this strong work effort, they can make a series of it. (I woofed
last year when we were up 3-1...I ain't going to do THAT again.  I'll
have to be quietly happy with a solid performance.  ;)
