And won't they have to change their name to the "Steelers" or something.
The only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by
the tire fire a  few years back.

Then again if the NBA can have the Utah Jazz or the L.A. Lakers (think about
it, what lakes are in L.A.) then I guess the NHL can have the Hamilton Oilers.
