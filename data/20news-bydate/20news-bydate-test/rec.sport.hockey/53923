Whoa there!  Lighten up, Andrew!  When I was referring to "you dorks at
the Western Business School", I was specifically referring to those
assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of
Minnesota for no apparent reason.  Being Canadian, and one who has
friends who attended UWO, I personally don't want to be associated with
the idiots who wrote those messages.  One more thing, Andrew...until
this season, the Leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen
years (have they won the Cup during our lifetime?)...so the North Stars
haven't been the only "shit" team in the Norris.
