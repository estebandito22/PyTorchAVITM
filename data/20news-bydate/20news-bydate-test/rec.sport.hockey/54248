Hey,guess what's coming to ESPN for a change? A playoff which doesn't
involve the Pens. Not that there is anything wrong with that...

ESPN games :

Thursday  Game3 Pens at Devils at 7:30(Gary Thorne and Bill Clement)
Saturday  Game4 Caps at NY Isles at 7:30(Tom Mees and John Davidson)

ABC game :

Sunday    Game4 Pens at Devils at 1:00 (Gary Thorne and Bill Clement)

ESPN named its #2 broadcast team on Tuesday. It paired Tom Mees(play by
play) with John Davidson(analyst).
