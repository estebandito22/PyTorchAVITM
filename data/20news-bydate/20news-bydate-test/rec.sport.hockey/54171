No, Boston probably won't go down easy, but if the Sabres hadn't won
game one Buffalo would have been out in four.

And what problem are you having with playoff games here in
Buffalo???!!!??? There's the Sabres-Bruins, Quebec-Montreal, and
whatever ESPN and ABC show, and on opposite nights there's
Toronto-Detroit and whatever ESPN(/ABC) shows.  More hockey than a
good chunk of North America, either side of the border.  It's
wonderful, and there are thousands of folks who'd kill to be in your
shoes, coverage-wise.
