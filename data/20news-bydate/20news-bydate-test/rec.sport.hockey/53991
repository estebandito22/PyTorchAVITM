     Well now the Sabres are up 3 - 0 in games, and its to
     bad that Boston isn't putting up more of a fight as
     that could have been the best series of the playoffs,
     I think Boston will come out smoking in the next
     two games and that Buffalo will end the series in
     game six back in Buffalo, and say, how about those Islanders?
     they are up 2 - 1 on the Capitals and will probably
     win the series, only to be clobbered by the Penguins who
     should eliminate the Devils in the next game.
     I cannot see (i'm sad to say) anyone beating the 
     Penguins this year (again) and they will take cup # 3 
     I'm afraid.  well talk to ya later.
