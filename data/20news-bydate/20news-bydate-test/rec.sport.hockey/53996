Chevy has let in 2 or 3 soft goals so far, but they all didn't matter.
However, his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up
big when it counts.  The score was 4-0 I think when the goal you mentioned
was scored.  In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming
back, Chevy was exceptional.  I can see him as a Barraso style playoff
goalie:  inconsistant when there's nothing on the line,
but comes up big when really needed.  I guess we'll both find out.
