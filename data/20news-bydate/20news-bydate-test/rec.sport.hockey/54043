At least last night there was some excitement. The Pens 
didn't have it wrapped up before the game was half over like 
the previous two games. I'm not sure if NJ just rose up and 
played better or if the Penguins just started to play down 
somewhat. Probably it was somewhere in between. New Jersey 
seemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end. They 
did much more swarming around, which at least kept an 
element of suspense in the game. No question that Billington 
helped make it more interesting also. Claude Lemieux didn't 
help the cause any though, with his ejection early in the 
game. So, who's going to start in the Devils goal for the 
"final" game Sunday? ;-) Sorry. I couldn't help myself.
