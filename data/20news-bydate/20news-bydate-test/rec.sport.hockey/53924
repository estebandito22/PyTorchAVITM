	On Tuesday, when it was raining in Chicago, ESPN provided 
bonus hockey coverage.  Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off
that the NY-Wash OT was replaced with the Angels-?? game.  People must
realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the U.S  
The baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so
they can't skip the baseball game.  Why don't you people CHILL OUT
and enjoy whatever coverage you can get.
