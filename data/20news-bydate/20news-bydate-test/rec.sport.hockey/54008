They _finally_ started going to the net!  See what happens when you 
create some traffic?  Muller deserves full marks (what a player!),
and Damphousse finally started skating.  Roy (thankyouthankyouthankyou)
was excellent.  Did you see that third period save on Young?  And the 
defense was taking out Quebec players in the zone.

Anybody else wonder if Hextall will feel like a dweeb when he finds 
out that the winning goal went in off his own D-man's skate?  Whatta
suck.  Although he _is_ playing really well.

>Life doesn't get better than this!!!!!!!!!

Sure it does.  On Sunday when the B's are golfing and the Habs are tied
2-2 you'll see what I mean! :-) :-)
