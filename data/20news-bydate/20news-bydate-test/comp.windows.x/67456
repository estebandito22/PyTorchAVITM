Hi!

Personally, I like NeXTSTEP very much. Even more when I realise how much a  
burden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better  
than I like C++.

But, sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be  
MS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments  
that come close to NeXTSTEP, the appkit etc. Also, environs that support rapid  
prototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want  
to do real work.

Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews  
(what it is exactly, I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I  
started with NeXTSTEP.)

Thanks,
