Subject: program to display .gif files?
Lines: 17

It seems silly, but while I've located things like tgif that can  edit
gif  files, and various tools to convert to/from gif format, I haven't
been able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays  a
gif file in it.  I've looked thru various faq files, also to no avail.
Is there one lurking about in some  archive?   Nothing  sophisticated;
just "show the pretty picture"?

Alternatively, if I could locate the specs for gif, I don't suppose it
would be too hard to write it myself, but I have no idea where to even
start looking for the spec.  (Well, actually, I do have an idea - this
newsgroup.  ;-)
