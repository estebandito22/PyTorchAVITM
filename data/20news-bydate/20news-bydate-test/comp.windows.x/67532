Hi, 
	Could some please tell me the errors of my ways. 
	I am trying to update a drawable. This drawable 
	happens to be a Pixmap on a button. 
	
	The problem is that after I do the :
XClearArea(XtDisplay(m_usr[0]),XtWindow(m_usr[0]), 80, 8, 40, 40, True);

	This appears to work. I then do

sprintf(tmp_str,"R=%d",++fun);
XDrawString(XtDisplay(m_usr[0]), bmaps[0] ,my_gc, 78, 10, tmp_str, (strlen(tmp_str)) );

	The problem is that the new info is drawn but the old info is
	still there. Even if I pass XClearArea a False and see it clear
	when it redraws the new info, the old info is still there.


Help Please!!!
        Thanks
