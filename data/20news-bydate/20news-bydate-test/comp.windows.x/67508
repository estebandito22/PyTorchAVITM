Greetings,
  I need some help with the detail of geometry specification.  I have a
program that uses Xlib to create a simple window.  I tried to hard code
the x,y location in XCreateWindow but it didn't work.  I also tried
XSetStandardProperties, XSetWMHints with no luck.  Could somebody
enlighten me on this subject.

Hans.
