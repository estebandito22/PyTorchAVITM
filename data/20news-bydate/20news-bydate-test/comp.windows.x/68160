I am having trouble compiling xtmenu.  I am running on a Sparc IPC
using SunOS 4.1.1 and OpenWindows 3.  I am getting undefined references
to arguments to XtSetArg such as XttextEdit, XttextRead, etc.  Am I
using the wrong version of a library? missing an include file?  Any
help would be greatly appreciated.

Jeff.
