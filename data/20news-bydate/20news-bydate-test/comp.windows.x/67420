You have to do the same sorts of things that Xt does with its main loop.
That is, you have to rig up a timer queue, and you have to put a 
select(2) or poll(2) call in your main loop.  You can obtain the 
file descriptor of the X display connection using 
    fd = ConnectionNumber (display);

The functionality of the main loop dispatcher in Xt is quite useful.
The good news is, you can get the source and plagiarize!
