How are you, Everybody?

I installed X11R5 on our IBM RS6000 workstation. OS version is AIX 3.2.3.
There was no problem in installation.
But there was a problem in invoking 'xinit'.
When I invoke 'xinit', there is a error message as follows:

giving up.
xinit: unable to connect to X server
xinit: No such process (errno 3): Server error.

I'm a navice. So I don't know the reason why I get this message.
Please help me. I am waiting for your help.

Thanks for reading this mail.
