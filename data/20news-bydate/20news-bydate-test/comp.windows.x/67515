I would have appreciated an announcement of the policy change - 
Dartmouth will not be able to run xv 3.0, and I'm probably going 
to have to take v2 off line (I somehow missed the "shareware"
designation in the README of v2, and didn't realize that we were
supposed to register).

I also debate whether this, with the new "institutions must pay"
policy belongs in the contrib directory on export - to me, "contrib"
means "contributed" (i.e. no strings, except copyright) attached.
