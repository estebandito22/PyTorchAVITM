If you installed X lib Xt by redefining ProjectRoot, you will find that
 during the install it recompiles one of the files in X lib that does the
search for XKeysmDB and embeds the search path for the file based on whatever
ProjectRoot was defined. TO confirm this what happened, because I'm 
guessing, go to mit/lib/X and do
strings XStrKeySym.o | egrep XKeysymDB
