Help, anyone!

I have a X client that is abnormally terminated with the following message:

XIO:   fatal IO error 22 (Invalid argument) on X server "xxxxx:0.0"
       after 10058 requests (10057 known processed) with 78 events remaining.

It has been known to occur when displaying on the Xsun (X11R4) server.  It
occurs with a higher frequency when the client displays on the Xdomain
(X11R4) server running on DomainOS 10.3.5 on an Apollo.

Anybody know why this may be happening? Any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated.

Reply-To: has been set to me.  I'll summarize to the net.
