Our group is interested in using a 'pixmap' format for multi-colored
icons/buttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from
'resource' files. Using pbmplus we can easily move to/from Xpm to our other
environments of MS-Windows and OS/2 PM :-(. We were wondering if Xpm or some
other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the X
consortium for R6 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by
X. 

Along the same subject line, is the reason the standard X pixmap is not used
because it doesn't have an associated colormap and other attributes? or is it
more involved? just wondering why there aren't editors for pixmaps out there
for the 'original' format.

Email replies preferred. Thanks in advance.
