Subject: Motif 1.2 and OW 3.0 / compiling xcoral

I've built xcoral on my system (SunOS 4.1.3, X11R5, Motif 1.2, OW 3.0)
and it builds fine, but when I run it, any child windows that xcoral
opens,
1) locks the mouse into the window area
2) doesn't accept any input from the mouse.

Needless to say, this is a pain in the ass, as I have to go find an
empty terminal to login and kill xcoral.

Is this a problem with OpenWindows or Motif?  Is there a patch?
