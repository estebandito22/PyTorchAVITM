I have the task to program a X application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which I can draw something.
Unfortunately some basic books on the topic of X application programming are not available to me for the moment.

I am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07, VUE and X11R4 using Xt anbd Xaw.

What I did until now:
I initialized the X Intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with XtAppInitialize. I passed as a application_class name 'commandWidgetClass'.
Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and
passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues.
When I call XtRealizeWidget, I get a window of the specified size, but I have no idea how I can draw something in it.

Can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets ?
In which situation it is useful to use them and in which not ?

Thanks very much in advance
