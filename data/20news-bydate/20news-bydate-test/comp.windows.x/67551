Hello,

  I am considering buying the Hummingbird X-Windows software for a MS-Windows
3.1 PC (386-40MHZ, NE2000 Ethernet board).  Would anyone tell me if they
are using this package in a similar environment and if they are happy with
it?  I will be connecting to Sun SparcStation 10 running Sun OS 4.1.3.

Thanks very much,
