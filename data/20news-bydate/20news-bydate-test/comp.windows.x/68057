Ok, I'm being driven batty.


Trying to create popup-menus (ie. button3 press, and a menu
appears).  I would really like to use the standard Athena
classes to achieve this goal, but for my best attempts
I cannot get the menus to come up without using a MenuButton
as the parent of the widget tree.  I know this should be
possible to to with an XtPopupSpringLoaded() and a
little twiddling, but something is escaping me.
