I am working for a company which has only one connection to the Internet.
This is through a firewall gateway (unix workstation). I would like to be
able to telnet to a host outside the company and set the DISPLAY to my PC
which is running an X-terminal emulator (eXceed/W). The display can be set
to the gateway workstation with no problem but when I set the variable to 
my IP address I get a "Error: Can't open display" message. 

This can't be that hard to work around can it?

BTW I have no trouble running x-clients on local workstations (in the company)
and having them display on my PC.
