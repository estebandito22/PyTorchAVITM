	Are there any widgets, function 
	librarys for drawing networks, 
	graphs etc ? (Not tree views) 
	Freeware, shareware, comercial...
	Like this, for instance:
                                                               
                          O
                          |
                          |
                O---------O=======>O
               / \        |
              /   \       |
        O----O.....O      O
            / \
           /   \ 
          O     O

	* Just by giving the associations 
	  between the nodes. Automatic
	  layout generation.

	* It would be nice if any node 
	  symbols could be used. Maybe 
	  even to insert widgets as nodes.

	* Using different line styles etc.
	  for describing associations.

	Any information would be appreciated,
	thanks in advance,
