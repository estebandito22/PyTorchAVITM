Hi! I've just installed the new XArchie 2.0.1 and it all works
fine, except:

on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the
program don't work at all, but on the BW terminal it works fine.
I can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't
give the neat-o change when busy action. (Other programs with
similar actions, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.)

The X-interface author, George Ferguson, suggests it might be a
problem with the X intrinsics, but isn't willing to hack around
to fix it himself. But I know zero about X programming, so I
don't think I can find it. 

Does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem?

Andrew
