I understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets:

                       callbacks and actions

The problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of application code
that performs a lot of drawing into a window. I want to connect this to a
widget. No problem so far. I could use a callback function or an action to do this, processing any events afterwards.

But because the drawing takes some while, I want the application code sequence
to be able to be interrupted by events. Then I want to handle the events
and resume with processing the application code at the point it was
interrupted.
It seems to me that this isn't possible, but how can I give the user the
impression that his inputs are immediately processed ?

Has anybody an idea?

Please answer via e-mail.

Thanks in advance.
