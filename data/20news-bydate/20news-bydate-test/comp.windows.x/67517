You need to start the X-server with -indirect its_name.

If you start it with -indirect localhost, it use the loopback adress as
it's adress. So when it try to contact another host, this one try to answer
on its loopback adress. Not good.

Remember that every machine has the adress 127.0.0.1 on the loopback network.
