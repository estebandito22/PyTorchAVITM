Hi, friends,

Our SPARC workstation is now equippied with a GT-accelerator. we want to use
it to display stereo images. The accelerator has double buffers. How can we
access the buffers and switch between them ? With which functions can we do 
that ? with functions from XGL, Phigs, Xlib or Xlib-extension ?

Your help will be highly appreciated.
