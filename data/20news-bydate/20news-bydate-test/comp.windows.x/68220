I am tunning into this newgroup after a long time. Could somebody tell me 
what the slave mode in the xterm is? and what can it be used for? Any info
where I can get more info or examples. I want to use a bunch of xterms and 
send the input from one application to these xterms and get the output on the
xterms. Please email me any info. 

Thanks,
Lourdu
