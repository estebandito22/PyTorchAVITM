I have a SPARC-2 with 2 CGSIX cards in it.  I'd like
to have the R5 server recognize the second card.


I mknod created a /dev/cgsix1 device, but when I brought up the
server, the second device was ignored.  

How do I setup the second card?


Note:  If I borrow a cgthree card, and put a cgthree and
a cgsix card in the same SPARC-2 box, the R5 server finds
the second card. I then set the DISPLAY to the
second card, and start a second window manager.  

Worse case is I trade cards with someone, but maybe someone
out there has seen this problem already...


email is preferred... post if you must...

Thanks in advance....


Jim
