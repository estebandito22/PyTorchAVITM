You don't give the precise error message, but I assume that
the making of the target fails, because make can't find the rules.

We've seen this happen with SunOS 5.x make as well and aat this
point I'm not sure why it happens. It seems to happen
with large Makefiles. The entries near the end get lost.
Small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem,
as it does in your example.

In the MIT R5 distribution + R5.SunOS5.patch this can happen with
the target ``Makefiles'' in one of the doc directories.

This is really weird. Are your *really* sure that you were using GNU make?
