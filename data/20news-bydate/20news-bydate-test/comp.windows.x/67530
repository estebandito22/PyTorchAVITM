i want to do something like this:

  date | xcb -s 0 | xcutsel

to get the output of the date command put into the XPRIMARY selection.
unfortunately, xcutsel is an interactive little bugger and there isn't a
command argument to tell it to just do it and not put up its little
window.  so, is there some other command that i CAN use like this?  or,
is there an analog to xcb that will put stuff in XPRIMARY instead of cut
buffer 0?
