I have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes
and collects data from that nodes periodically. I need to display this data on
my X Application. I tried
to invoke this server using XtAddAppTimeout which works ok. But the
problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. So I doesn't
returns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and
It doesn't respond to users input. I button press events are queued and
exected after server finished its task. Now I am going to try AppAddInput
call. So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe.

I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client
which is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may
be able to clarify.

1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !!
   Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork
   my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes. How
   should I call this processes.?

2) Can I fork more than one processes. So that I can read from more
   than one servers input.

Thanks

Samir Patel
