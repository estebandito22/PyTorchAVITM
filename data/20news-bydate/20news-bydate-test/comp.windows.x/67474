We are making a transition from NextStep to X-windows. I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs.  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT. 
So far I've drawn the following conclusions:

1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs
2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit
3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one)
4) tcl/tk is a little buggy
5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info)
6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product.
7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money)
8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work
9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ?
10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development.

I'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products.

thanks
