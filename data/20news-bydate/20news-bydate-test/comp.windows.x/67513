The Only directory I know of that lists commercial and non-commercial
widgets is the ICS Widget Data book.  ICS sells the widgets for various
prices.  There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. 

The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where 
you pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you 
can use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate 
widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. 
The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets
such as those used in dataviews.  I dont know there pricing schemes
but It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex 
widgets, especially if you only one customer to distribute to. 

This is the extent that I know about them except that I got their 
databook catalog  and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there)

I dont work for ICS or have any widgets being sold by them.
hope this helps you.
