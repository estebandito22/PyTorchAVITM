        I am looking for info on products that can take
Windows source on a Unix box (such as Sparc), and produce a
Motif executable.  Another requirement is that MFC 2.0 should
be supported.  I already know of:

        Wind/U  by Bristol Technologies
        Hunter SDK
        MainWin by MainSoft

        Are there any others?

	I will post a summary if it's wanted.
