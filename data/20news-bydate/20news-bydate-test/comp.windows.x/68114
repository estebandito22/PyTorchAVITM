Hello,

I have a problem with X11R5 on a Sun386i an I hope that someone can help
me with it.
I've built X from the MIT sources after applying all patches I have got (I
think 23). Building was easy. After installing everything I started X but
nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed, the machine seemed
to hang. I loged in from another machine an found the Sun386i running well.
'ps' told me that there's a X-server and a xterm running. And with some 
experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing ^D I blindly hit the
xterm, endet the session and got my prompt back.
I guess it's a device problem but I did not find the correct device yet.
I've got a Sun386i with a b/w framebuffer (ACE-6 0688 94V-0, Rev 53)
SunOS 4.0.2 and ROM 4.4.
Please help me. I'm able to run clients on the Sun and send the output to
other machines but that's not what I did it for.

Thanks in advance,
Stefan
