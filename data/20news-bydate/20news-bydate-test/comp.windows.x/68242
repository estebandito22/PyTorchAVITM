I'm a Solaris 2.1 user with a classic workstation.

I have compiled xfig 2.1.7 version with -DOPENWIN flag to use it with 
openwindows, but when i run it, the program runs and runs and runs (15 minutes)
and never is ready to work with it. The labels are not completed and i can't
push any button.

I have no problem if i does not run the openwindows but X.

Any solution?

Thanks in advance and excuse for my english.
