Hi there,

I'm looking for tools that can make X programming easy. 
I would like to have a tool that will enable to create X motif
GUI Interactivly. Currently I'm Working on a SGI with forms.
A package that enables to create GUI with no coding at all 
(but the callbacks). 
Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks Gabi.
