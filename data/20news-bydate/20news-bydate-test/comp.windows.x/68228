Hi there,


  Do someone of you have a program for sending a key event
to another window but it MUST appear in that window....

I have used xsendevent.tar package but it does not do that !!!

For example, if I get a program executing:

--------------
#!/bin/sh
read something
....
....
echo $something
....
....
--------------

and if I send the key event "<KeyPress>a,<KeyRelease>a"
to that window then I will get:

something=a


Thanks in advance.
