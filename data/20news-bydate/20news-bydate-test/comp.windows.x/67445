Summary: Go ahead... swamp me.  <EEP!>

I'm not familiar at all with the format of these "X-Face:" thingies, but
after seeing them in some folks' headers, I've *got* to *see* them (and
maybe make one of my own)!

I've got "dpg-view" on my Linux box (which displays "uncompressed X-Faces")
and I've managed to compile [un]compface too... but now that I'm *looking*
for them, I can't seem to find any X-Face:'s in anyones news headers!  :-(

Could you, would you, please send me your "X-Face:" header?

I *know* I'll probably get a little swamped, but I can handle it.

	...I hope.
