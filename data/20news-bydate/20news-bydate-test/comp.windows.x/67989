Hello everybody out there !

I'm trying to compile X11R5pl23 and Motif 1.2.1 on a HP running
HP-UX 8.05. But it' seems to be not very succesful, because 
I have only hp.cf config-files for HP-UX 7.0. 

I tried standard cc and X was compiled with a lot of warnings.
The motif applications are compiled quite well, but they won't run.
I receive the XKeysymDB error which is reported in FAQ, but
I cannot fix it. The XKeysymDB-file is at the right location and it
works fine under SunOS.
Probably I have started the compilation Prozess only with a wrong
config-file.

Please help me !
  
Thanx in advance 
  Markus
