I tried to send this as private mail, but mail to benj@ossa.hq.nasa.gov was
rejected, so here it is:

Here is an extract from the README file that comes with MacX:

Users of remote commands with Sun machines may find that their remote commands 
appear to do nothing and there is no output from the Sun machine.  This is due 
to a feature of the Sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from 
requesting machines that are not known to the Sun|s network address (/etc/hosts
or NIS hosts) database.  To successfully use remote commands with a SunOS-based
machine, there must be an entry in the network address database for the 
Macintosh which is running MacX.
