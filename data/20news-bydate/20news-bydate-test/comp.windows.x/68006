Hi, there,
    I'm trying to build X11R5 mit core distribution on a SparcStation running
SunOS 4.1.1. The only thing I change is the ProjectRoot in site.def. When the
"make World" process goes to "cc -o xdm ...", I get the following error:

ld: Undefined symbol
   __C0095A2A
*** Error code 2

And the process continues to finish. Does anybody know what's wrong? Thanx for
any info.
