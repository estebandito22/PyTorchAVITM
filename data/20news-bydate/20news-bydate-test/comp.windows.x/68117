  I'm posting this request again since the last one had no title.
 
  I'm looking for X server software on DOS or Windows.
 
  I've already seen Desqview/X and XVision but would like to be aware
 of other solutions, namely public domain or shareware implementations.
 
  I'd also like to know, in the commercial case, about possible problems,
 incompatibilities, available window managers and libraries, etc.
 
  If you have any experiences in this area please let me know.
 

  C U!
