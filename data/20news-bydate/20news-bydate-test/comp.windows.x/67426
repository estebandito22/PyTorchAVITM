OK, many people emailed me asking for information on Congruent Corporation's

give better attribution, but the mail is in a different application on VMS :-()

The number to call in New York City is (212)431-5100

The email address is info@congruent.com

The product is NTNIX.

Other details I do not know.

They said they'd send me email info, but as yet it has not arrived. More
as I get it. Cheers Folks!
