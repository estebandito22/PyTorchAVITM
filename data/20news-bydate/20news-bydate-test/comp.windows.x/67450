I don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through
the XView xv_get() function:

   x = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_X);
   y = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_Y);

For example, if I set XV_X & XV_Y to 50,50 the frame comes up
in the correct position, with the top left corner (the size
handle) at 50,50. xv_get() returns 50,50 as well. But later on
xv_get() returns 5,25 without any intervening xv_set(my_frame,
XV_?). My frame is fitted around a canvas, and it turns out
(by measuring on the screen) that 5,25 is the position of the
first pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin. What
gives? Any help most appreciated!

Derek

P.S. On a related subject, is there any way of querying the
window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around
frames, etc.?
