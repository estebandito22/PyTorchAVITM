Hi Netters,
	Having inherited a Solbourne (S-4000 : Sun 4 Compatible), I was wondering
if somebody has ported X11R5 to this beast. Since Solbournce Computer Inc. folded
up I don't know where I can get the kernel to move from R4. Since they never
joined the MIT Consortium, the regular distribution doesn't work. Any pointers
will be highly appreciated.

Julian
