This discussion on viewing .ps files undex X11 seems rather interesting
but I fail to understand the reason it is not contained in 2 at most
newsgroups.

I am subscribed to comp.text.interleaf and I could care less about
.ps viewing under X11. I am sure that members of this group interested in
the topic can followup by looking at other newsgroups.

Could you please remove the comp.text.interleaf from your distribution?
Just as a nettish sort of courtesy.

Best regards.
