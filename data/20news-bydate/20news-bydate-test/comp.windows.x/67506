Subject: Need patches to use /dev/cgtwelve0
Organization: University of Virginia Computer Science Department
Lines: 8

The good news is we just got two Sparc10's. The bad news is
that /dev/cgtwelve0 is apparently not supported in X11R4 or
X11R5. Does anyone know of a patch (and how I can obtain it)
to either X version that will enable us to use X11 on our
Sparc10's?
