Are there any graphics texts with examples/demos/projects directly in
X?

The last time I taught the course, I used a popular graphics text that
uses its own graphics package, with implementations available for
X/Mac/PC.  The problem was that after the course the students were good
at programming in the artificial package, but frustrated that they
couldn't really use their skill for other work.
