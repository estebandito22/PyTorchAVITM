I think your performance will depend upon the X server. 

I'm running Linux and XFree86 on a 33Mhz 486DX with 4MB of RAM (8MB swap) and
it runs just fine.  Its a lot better than some of the crappy old Xterminals
in the labs at school anyway.

You could probably outfit a 386SX with a minimal Linux/X setup for $900
and be better off than with an Xterminal. IMHO.
