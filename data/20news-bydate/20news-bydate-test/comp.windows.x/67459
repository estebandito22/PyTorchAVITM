Very interested indeed! This is against this kind of "changes" that the GNU
COPYLEFT is protecting us.

Anyway, at SIMULOG, we will abandon xv. We were using it mostly for slide-
shows because of its "-loop" feature that display does not have (display
from the *wonderful* ImageMagick package! :-D), but I think I will implement
it myself (even a shell-script should do the job) and forget xv.

Cheers,
Christophe.
