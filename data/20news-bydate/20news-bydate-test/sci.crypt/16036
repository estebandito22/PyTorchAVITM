I was under the impression (from reading Denning's description of the
Clipper's operation) that the same session key *is* used in both directions for
encrypting the message text, but that each chip uses it's own key for
encrypting the session key into the law-enforcement field.  So, you only
need to know the U key for one of the phones involved to decrypt the
messages in both directions.
