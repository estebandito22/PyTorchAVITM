One unreliable data point: while looking over the shoulder of a
recording engineer, I decided that he was seeing a raw error rate of
about 1 in 1e6 on a CD ``master.''  Both the extrapolation to
mass-market CDs and my state of mind while doing the arithmetic (I was
waiting for him to finish so we could go get something to eat) are
questionable.
