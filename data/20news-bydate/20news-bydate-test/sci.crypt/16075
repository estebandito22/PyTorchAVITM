I'd use a secret (nope, obscure) cryptographic encoding to expand the 
30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block. The redundancy hereby introduced 
can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy 
replaced the L.E. block by random data. 

And of course the L.E. block would be used to initialise the encryption 
of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E. block must 
be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back. 

For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing 
a constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding 
it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies 
of this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption 
algorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. If the 
receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and 
it will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting 
faulty plaintext, you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own 
safety ;-(. 

The `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed 
for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents 
them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the 
serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks 
within the transmission. These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as 
they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol.

So don't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E. about the 
tapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks 
than those suggested above. Of course it's absolutely crucial that the 
algorithms (and protocols) remain secret. Personally I doubt they will.
