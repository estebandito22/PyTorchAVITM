  So, you admit that Clipper opens the doors wide for the following scenario:

  FEDS: We need the keys to Joe Blow's phone.

  ESCROW AGENT: Joe Blow?  You have a warrant to tap his line?

  FEDS: Well, no, but we have a warrant to tap Carlos "Slime-Devil" Gonzales'
     line, and our tap shows that Mr. Gonzales is using Mr. Blow's phone.

  ESCROW AGENT: Well, OK....
