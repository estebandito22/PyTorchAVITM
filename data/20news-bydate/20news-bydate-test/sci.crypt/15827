I seem to recall Rush saying that he has a CompuServe account.  If anyone
wants to E-mail him, all we need is his account number (i.e.: 12345,6789)
and then we could e-mail him via gateway by using a dot instead of a comma
like so: "12345.6789@compuserve.com".  (THIS IS *NOT* HIS ADDRESS.)

So, does anyone know his e-mail address?  He *says* he uses it all the time.
(I wonder if he reads alt.fan.rush-limbaugh...   His ego is big enough!)
