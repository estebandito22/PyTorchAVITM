Let's put it this way, they have a charter and several executive orders
to obey, among other things which *explicitly* prohibit sharing this
information (unless things have changed withing the last little while).
I suppose they could ignore it, if they choose.  But I doubt they would.
For an authoritative look at the NSA, get Bamford's "The Puzzle Palace".
That's all I can say.
