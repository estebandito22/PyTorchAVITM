We would like to keep it that way. Thats the point. By reacting
strongly and forcefully now, we will assure that we continue to remain
free. You cannot overreact to a threat like this. The worst that
happens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort. The worst that
happens if we underreact is tyranny. I prefer overreaction myself.

Doesn't that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is?

Only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain
ourselves in this state of even moderate freedom. I suggest that
overreacting now and in the future is a good thing.
