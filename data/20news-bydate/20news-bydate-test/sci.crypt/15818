   I've been thinking about how difficult it would be to make PGP available
in some form on EBCDIC machines.  The message authentication would be ugly,
but I think at least the IDEA encryption could work, if PGP had a switch
to tell it to use IDEA in OFB-mode or ECB-mode.  In OFB-mode, errors in
translating EBCDIC-->ASCII-->EBCDIC would only affect their byte, not the
16 bytes that would be affected under CBC.
   Is PGP set up to use different IDEA modes?  I don't recall notincing it
in the executable, but I haven't gone through it as carefully as I probably
should....
