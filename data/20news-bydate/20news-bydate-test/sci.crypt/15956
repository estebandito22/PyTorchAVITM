No no no no no no no.

It will go like this:

FEDS: We need the key to phone 334RE67D99.

ESCROW: You have a warrant to tap the line phone 334RE67D99 is on?

FEDS: Yes.

ESCROW: Fine, here is our key.

What happens is, Feds tap a line; find Clipper is being used; extract
serial number; get key; decipher convo.  The serial number is never
registered to a specific owner, it is _sent_ as part of the
conversation.  If I give you my Clipper phone, you do not need to
re-register it (mainly because it was never 'registered' to me in the
first place).

There are a lot of things that bother me about Clipper, but this is
not one of them.  Let's get our facts straight and not waste effort
demolishing straw men.
