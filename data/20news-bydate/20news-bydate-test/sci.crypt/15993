Glenn,

Thanks for posting that.  I was surprised to notice, however, that one
question I might have expected to be asked was not:  "Are all forms of
strong encryption other than the Clipper to be made illegal?"  Speaking
of which, is anyone aware of whether that question *has* been asked of
any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government?  I have
not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been
reported, but I could have easily missed it.
