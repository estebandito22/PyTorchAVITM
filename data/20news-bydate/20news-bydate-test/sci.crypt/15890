Thank you Andrew.  Not only for the firm rebuttal, but for understanding the 
difference between communism and socialism (even though this is off topic).
Why do people just not understand that just because all those pretty songs about
the land of the free and so on sound nice, that they may not be true?
Take off those rose colored glasses and get a clue (to use two of the better 
cliches around)
thanks you again
