  The reason I could theoretically trust Apple (though I'm a PC person
myself :-) ) is that Apple has to worry about their customers deserting
them if they screw up badly enough.  The government doesn't have any such
worry; it can change the rules by force to get the outcome it wants.  This
is the ultimate reason why private enterprise is usually more efficient
than government agencies.
