        I would guess that they won't use Clipper at all.  What they will
do is use their STU-IIIs amoung themselves and the governmental agencies
they need to talk to, and ignore Clipper.  After all, if it's not secure
enough for the agency/department they are communicating with why should
the coprations trust it?
