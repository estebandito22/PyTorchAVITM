This sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser, not a weakness in
DES.  Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper
that came out about 2.5 years ago, in both Computer Communications
Review and Usenix.  For that matter, it was loudly discussed on the
Kerberos mailing list even earlier.

The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES, and everything to do
with bad password selection.

I'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks
possible on DES.  I'm quite dubious that private research labs know
them.  And the parameters of a brute-force attack are quite well
established; see, for example, the Garon and Outerbridge paper in the
July '91 Cryptologia.  You're not going to do it in an hour with only
``rather powerful DES hardware''.  I'll leave the arithmetic as an
exercise for the reader.  On average, you'll need to do 2^55 trials.
Pick your own parameters for how fast the DES engine runs, and for
how many such engines are used.
