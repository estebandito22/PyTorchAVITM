Well, isn't this just a hoot! :)  All I read on this group is a bunch
of ppl fearing the misuses of information by the big bad evil govt.
This just happens to be a case of an ordinary-joe-netter, who decided
that he would create and/or distribute some misinformation.  Ppl buy
into BS posts like this (I know, because I forwarded a copy of the
post to my office mate, who turned around and was (although he won't
admit it...sorry Joe!) ready to get in a fight about F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E!!!)
Please, if we're going to hold our govt (which admittedly has had and
still has its problems) to high standards, then mustn't we follow these
too?  Electronic Freedoms only go so far.
