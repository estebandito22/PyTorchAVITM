Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer,
I'll supply one.

Yes, even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering.  Basically to turn left, you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first, causing a counteracting lean to
occur to the left.  It is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle
than a bicycle though, because of the extra weight.  (Ok, so my
motorcycle is heavy.  Maybe yous isn't.)
