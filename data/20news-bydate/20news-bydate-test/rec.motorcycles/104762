What worked for me on my RD350 was to lean towards the dog as I modulated
throttle to keep my ankle just ahead of his teeth.  After a few seconds of
warm pipe firmly wedged on his shoulder he turned his face sideways to see
what was so warm and got his mouth/nose/muzzle burned on the pipes.  One
yip and he veered away, never to chase me again.

If you think I speak for AT&T you might have more lawyers than sense.
