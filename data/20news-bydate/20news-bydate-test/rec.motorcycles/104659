ordered 2 fork seals and 2 guide bushings from CA for my FZR.  two weeks later
get 2 fork seals and 1 guide bushing.  call CA and ask for remaining *guide*
bushing and order 2 *slide* bushings (explain on the phone which bushings are
which; the guy seemed to understand).  two weeks later get 2 guide bushings.

*sigh*

how much you wanna bet that once i get ALL the parts and take the fork apart
that some parts won't fit?
