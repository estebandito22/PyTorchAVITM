I am looking at buying a Dual Sport type motorcycle. This is my first
cycle as well. I am interested in any experiences people have with
the following motorcycles, good or bad.

	Honda XR250L
	Suzuki DR350S
	Suzuki DR250ES
	Yamaha XT350

Most XXX vs. YYY articles I have seen in magazines pit the Honda XR650L 
against another cycle, and the 650 always comes out shining. Is it safe
to assume that the 250 would be of equal quality ?

Thanks... Joe
