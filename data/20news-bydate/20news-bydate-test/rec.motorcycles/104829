And DoDers are easily recognized by their own special wave.
Pay attention and I'll tell you how to do it. Hold your left hand out
in front of you, fingers straight but apart - like a vase. You may also
use your right hand if you have a throttle lock or are stopped. Bring
your fingertips and thumb together, touch, and open back to the starting
position. While you are doing this, move your hand slowly to the left.
Do it gracefully and with a waving motion. You are now imitating a
squid propelling itself about underwater probably in search of food,
drink, squids of the appropriate sexual orientation, or other squids to
go riding with.
