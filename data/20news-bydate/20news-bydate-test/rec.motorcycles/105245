I'm just starting out with motorcycles,  I've read up on the subject a bit,
talked to many of my friends who own/ride bikes and encourage me to do the
same.  But when I ask about what kind of bike i should be looking at... i get
varied answers.


I'm 6'3", about 230#, large/athletic build...  I suppose that would help to
determine the size bike i'd want.  I want something that's going to be fast and
powerful enough to satisfy certain cravings once i'm used to it.  I also want
something that is not going to be like a bronc my first time out.  Any ideas?!
