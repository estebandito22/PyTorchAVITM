After failing my State of New Hampshire Noise Gestapo test with my HD
Slash cut pipes I installed my new Bubs (which I had been planning to
do anyway), went to a different in spection station, and passed with no
problem at about 97 dB.

Two points:

First, I don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. 
Holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and
doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced
the dB level! So if any other NH riders need to get this done, make
sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from
the body.

Second, these Bub pipes are bloody terrific. At low revs or cruising
through town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thats
a more throaty, purring, rumble.  When you open her up to >3000 RPM
they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar. Best of both worlds!
