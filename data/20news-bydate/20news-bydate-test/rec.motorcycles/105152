This Summer I'm going to use my vacation drivin (riding)
through the States.
And I do Have some questions that I would like to post here::
Since I'm from Norway I was wondering
How much does it cost to rent a Bike in the States?

(I'm Probarly going to the San Fransisco/San Jose area
the ride around (I'think))

As you might have noticed I still haven't made any plans
so if you know about places I ought to visit 
Please e-mail me...

Since I hurt my pendulum
My life is all erratic.
My parrot, who was cordinal,
Is now transmitting static.
The carpet died, a palm collapsed
The cat keeps doing poo.
The only thing that keeps me sane
Is talking to my shoe.
