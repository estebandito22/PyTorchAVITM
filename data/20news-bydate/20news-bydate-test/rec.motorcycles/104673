You could, but it would be considerably cheaper to spend $8 or so on
a trickle charger from K-Mart, Venture, or Target, then it would be
to replace the halogen lamp power supply after you fuse it trying to
pump current into the battery...

While charging, the charger should be putting out around 14 or 15 volts
as well...
