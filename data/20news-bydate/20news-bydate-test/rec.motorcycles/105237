	No, it is the stock setup.  Someone really ought to put an end
	to the confusion regarding BMW's chain drive boxers.  Didn't
	someone post the FAQ on this some time ago?  In essence, it
	describes the problem BMW is having with their decision to
	settle down to a shaft drive as a standard.  They vacilate
	and persist in reintroducing the chain drive in various
	models.  (R/C)  Gosh.  Well, on with the crusade!
