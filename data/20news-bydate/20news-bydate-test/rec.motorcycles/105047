Any lock including the Kyptonite utypes are EASY to break into if the person has
the proper supplies and/or motivation. 3 minutes and your bike is gone!
I would be glad to explain but I dont want to contribute to any unlawful
activities. Especially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off
by such a trival tactic. WARNING NO lock alone is a safe deterent against theft,
the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lock-picker to walk away with your
property!  I personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock
of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned.
