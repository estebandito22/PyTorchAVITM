   I know the roads up there in Minnesota are pretty bad, but I doubt that
they are THAT bad.  I've never realy tried to watch my back tyre but, my 82
Maxim 750 will pull the front wheel off the ground if I pop the clutch.
Admittedly, it is easier with someone on back, maybe that's what keeps the
rear tyre down.  ;-)
