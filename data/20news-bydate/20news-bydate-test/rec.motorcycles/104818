I just got a K75 and had the heated grips installed.  As far as I can
tell the grips look and feel the same as the standard grips. 
They are *not* soft.  Last weekend I did a 500 mile round-trip and
got to a point where it was in the 30s and raining.  Those heated
grips were *great*.  I've only had the bike a month and the heated
grips are already one of my favorite features on the bike.
