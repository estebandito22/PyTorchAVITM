Oh yeah, all the time.  On a nice spring/summer day, I roll down the window
and drive around looking for bikes.  When a bike motors by in the opposite
direction, I stick my arm out and hi5'em.  My arm feels like a million 
bucks when I'm doing this a 60km/h.  I do the same thing with cyclists.
The only problem with hi5ing a cyclist is their always in the right hand lane.
I hafta roll down the other window and hi5 them on the back.  Oh well, I 
think they appreciate the thought. 

Regards, Ted.
