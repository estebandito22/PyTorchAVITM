Has anyone any experience with the (new?) Yamaha Cyclelok ?

It looks like it uses the same hardened steel as a Kryptonite U lock,
but unlike a U lock, it is hinged in 5 places and opens out to a large
rectangle (longer length than any U lock I have seen, plus it folds down
to real small), so you could lock the rear tire to a steel post for example.

I was curious as to how well the jointed sections would stand up to attack ?
