I would stongly recommend a factory service manual, and if you are not
an experienced machanic then get a chiltons or haynes (sp?) ALSO.
Make sure the bike has cooled at least 6 hours since being run.
Read the books and if you have more questions you could mail me.
Also, be very careful when tightening valve cover bolts.  They take
very little torque and breaking one is disaster.
