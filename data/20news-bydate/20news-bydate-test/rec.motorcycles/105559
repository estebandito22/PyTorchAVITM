I read about a SuperTrapp system called E.A.R that was supposed to be
quiet enough to pass some European standards.  Apparently it's not
on the market yet...

Yoshimura makes a few systems that are supposed to be "kind of" quiet.
They are also really light.  I'm planning on getting one of these 
systems soon, and will post the results.
