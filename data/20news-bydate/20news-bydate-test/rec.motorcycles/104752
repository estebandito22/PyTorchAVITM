  When did *you* go out and change the laws of physics? :-)  According to some
numbers I used to see bandied around, shaft drive is on the order of 95-97%
efficient, while chain drive is closer to 99%...   Seems to me that this makes
*chain* drive more efficient, hmmmmm???

  And granted, shaft has a lot less maintenance, which is fine, if you don't
mind less performance... :-) :-)
