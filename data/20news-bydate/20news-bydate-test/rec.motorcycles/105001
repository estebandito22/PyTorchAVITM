In the Dallas area, I just bought a can (it's for my best friend's bike... a
1986 XLH883, mines got a belt hahahahaha!!!) for $6.79 ($7.35 with tax) at
Bates Discount Cycle Parts on the southbound I-35E service road in Farmers
Branch just a couple miles north of the I-635/I-35E interchange. They have
about a dozen cans left.
