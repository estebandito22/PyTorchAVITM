	Interesting.  All I can say is that I haven't seen any wear in the
1000 miles I've used the stuff on the Ninja, and the bike stays soooo clean.

	I'll check back again in a few thousand more miles.

	While we're on the subject, whereinthehell can I find a 532x110
endless chain, other than the dealer (no, rivet-type master links are not
acceptable)?
