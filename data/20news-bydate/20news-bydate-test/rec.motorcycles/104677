  So, in short, the 3/8" cables seems to be pretty useless, I would guess.

  The larger cable seems to be a much better unit.

  I've got the larger cable - about 5/8" inch in diameter (actually, I think
its larger), about 4 feet long which coils into a 8 or 9 inch coil, with the
tubular key lock like the U-locks.  It has worked fine for me for two years
now, and *seems* (to me, anyway) that it is very secure.  It doesn't have the
weaknesses that the U-locks have other than the liquid nitrogen trick
supposedly, is much easier to store in my tankbag than a U-lock, and more
versatile.  I got mine from one of the mail-order houses (Motorcycle Accessory
Warehouse, I beleive), for $42.

  In combination with an ignition disable, and a couple of other deterrents,
all I *usually* worry about is vandalism.
