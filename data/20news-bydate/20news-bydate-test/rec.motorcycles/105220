Shaft: Bamboozle, beat, beguile, burn (or flame), deceive, hoax,
       hoodwink.

Drive: Campaign, crusade, push.

So, 'shaft drive' may be a campaign to decieve or a crusade of beguile,
efforts where are true to the spirit of this list.

Wheel: revolution, swing

Crusaders of beguile are innefective in revolutions and they cannot
swing, either, therefore shaft drives cannot do wheelies.
