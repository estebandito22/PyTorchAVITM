A few months ago, in one the the motorcycle mags, there was
an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to
be available thru BMW.  The idea was that the tape would look
black in sunlight, and reflect in other colors at night to
headlights.  It sounded like a nice way to add nighttime 
visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction.

I talked to the local BMW dealer about this.  I was told that the 
only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector, was it being 
used in a coming line of BMW clothing (rainsuits).  He wasn't aware 
of anything regarding self applied tape.

Has anyone come across this from BMW or any other source?

Thanks,
