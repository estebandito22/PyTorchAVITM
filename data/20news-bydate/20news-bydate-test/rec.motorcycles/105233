     Quite right, your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain
most of their charge if drained and dried well, but I'd throw out the
electrolyte and buy some more when you need it.


     And before anyone says I'm wrong, remember that new batteries almost
always come ready charged and dry, and they are perfectly OK even after
several years' storage at the shop.
