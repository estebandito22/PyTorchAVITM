Actually, a WERA racer, William Lumsden, considered running a Vmax in 
A Superstock.  He took it out to Talladega GPR for a practice day, and
_really_ annoyed the 600 riders -- they usually got caught behind a 
sideways Vmax in the corners, and if they passed him going in, he'd
blow by down the straight (usually wobbling).  Needless to say, since
he was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 CB400F, he decided against the Vmax.

Too bad.
