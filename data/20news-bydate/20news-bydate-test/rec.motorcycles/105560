a few weeks ago i was in the DMV with ken. i was standing in a mile long 
line waiting for some really bored looking person to fleece a bunch of 
people from some dough. ken was sitting on a chair next to our helmets 
wondering why everybody there looked to be about the social calibur of 
people you would find at a laundromat when some young woman walked in who 
required our conferring attentions. he came over and stood in line with me 
while we watched her fill out some forms and then we noticed a little kid 
about 4 years old reach over the bench and touch our helmets, one at a time. 
i didn't particularly mind, and neither did ken (that the kid was touching 
our helmets that is). but the helmets weren't on the most stable of 
platforms, so ken scooted over there to resettle them and as soon as he 
touched the helmets, mother of said child started shrieking at her kid "YOU 
STAY AWAY FROM THOSE YOU SHIT!" and whopped the tyke brutally about the head 
and shoulders.

i suppose it was our scary "sex drugs and unix" t-shirts that sent such 
bouts of terror through her body.
