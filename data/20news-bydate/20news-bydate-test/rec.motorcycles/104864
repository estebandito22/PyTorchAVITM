Hey now,

   I'm having the roughest time getting a company to cover
my new bike.  Here are some details about her and me:

I'm:

  single
  23
  riding with a clean record
  a homeowner
  a 'new' rider accoring to most companies
  not a member of MSF or AMA yet  



   She's:
 
   a '92 CBR600F2
   got 150 miles
   got temp plates still
   one screamin' bitch of a ride...


   Can you get me some ideas?  We can take them to private
email to lower the noise on the net.

   mrr3@po.cwru.edu is a good mail address.  I need to
hear something soon so I can keep her on the road...

   Thanks in advance,
   Mark
