A friend of mine (who's probably reading this right now) just bought a new
Yamaha Virago 750.  After spending 1-2 hours very late one chilly evening
watching him struggle with the bolts (had to remove the right peg, loosen
the brake pedal, &c. &c.) I've pretty much decided never to get this
particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil/filter
for me.  Compared to the 5-minute change he was used to for his Honda, this
is just a design flaw/oversight in my eyes.
