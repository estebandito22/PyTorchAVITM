On a related note (since UPS lost my Chain Wax and I'm still using PJ-1/Goo),
I found some great stuff to clean chain spooge of wheels.  It's called
Goo Gone and cleaned the spooge off my rear wheel faster than the Simple
Green cleaned the bug guts off my headlight.  Wonderful stuff.  I recommend
that we officially delcare it a DoD Wonder Spooge (tm) product.
