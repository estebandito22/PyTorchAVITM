Hi,
   I'm now in the market for buying a BMW.The ideal would be an R80 RS but I'd be
interested to here of any R80 for sale .Age is not a problem - I'm more
interested in a good example without a massive amount of miles and one which has
been well maintained as I intend to keep it well and for some time.

   I would also like to know if anyone has any sound advice as regards to
INSURANCE - 27yr old,licence for 9 years,no accidents/claims/convictions.Am I old
enough to get BMW owners club insurance yet or will I have to wait until next
year?
