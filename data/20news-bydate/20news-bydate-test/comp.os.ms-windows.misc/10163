Subject:        Help Needed w/ DOS Apps and Windows
Lines: 21

Since loading Windows, two of my DOS applications have been
acting strangely.  It appears that font changes and page
orientation changes (so far) are not being recognized in
WordPerfect/DOS and QuattroPro/DOS.  Another DOS application
does accept font and page orientation changes, so I don't
think the problem is with the printer.

I reloaded QuattroPro, and these changes are still not
accepted whether launching from Windows or the DOS prompt.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to look or how to
correct this problem?  I've ordered QuattroPro for Windows,
but need a landscape application printed immediately.  Please e-mail.

Thanks in advance!
