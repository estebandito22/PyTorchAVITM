Its my understanding that bus mice are more accurate and "stable" in
general than serial mice.  If I remember correctly, its because
of the differences in how the interrupts are handled, as well as
the fact that the mouse data is received over the computer bus
as opposed to a (9600 bps?) serial connection.

Is this just a general problem, or is it associated with a specific
application or group of applications?
