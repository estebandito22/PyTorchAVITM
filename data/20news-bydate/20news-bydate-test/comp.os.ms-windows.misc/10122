Development of what?  In-house apps?  Maybe, but  certainly not apps
to be sold on an open market.  Statistics like that are laughable,
because they may simply mean that there are not enough shrink-wrapped
usable apps for UNIX and they have to be developed disproportionately
often as compared to the installed UNIX base.
