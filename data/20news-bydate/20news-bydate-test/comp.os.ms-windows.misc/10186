Hi, I am trying to compile a chart for Windows and DOS performance
of local bus video card .  So if you have a DX2-66V and one
of the local bus video cards below, please email me your Winbench
3.11 and 3dbench(obtainable in ftp.wustl.edu, pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS)
scores.   Please give me Winmark score at 800x600x256 and
800x600x64K.  I will post the chart if enough response if received.

S3 805/928 based local bus card.
ATI Ultra Pro VLB
Orchid Celsius 9000 VLB
AGX based VLB cards(do they exist?)
