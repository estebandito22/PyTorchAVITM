 MIRROR is one of those DOS commands that didn't survive the change 
 from DOS 5.0.  It's been dropped, along with BACKUP, JOIN, EDLIN  
 and a couple other crummy old DOS commands.  You can still use the
 5.0 commands if you absolutely have to, but they are not included
 on the 6.0 distribution disks.

 However, in MIRROR's case, I'm 99.9% certain that it does not know
 anything about DoubleSpaced drives...
