My wife is a physiotherapist and she is looking for some cliparts of
skeleton and male/female body.  We're currently using Windows Draw 
which can import all kind of graphic formats.  Therefore, anything
will do.

Please advise of the existance of any freeware or commerical source
that we can turn to.  Since I don't normally read this newsgroup,
please responds via e-mail.


Thanks in advance.
