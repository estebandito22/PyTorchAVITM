Microsoft is the largest software company on the planet, yet I cannot think
of even *ONE* computing concept that they innovated and brought to market
before anyone else.  Xerox-PARC/Apple, Osborne, NeXT, GNU and others have 
been pioneers and led the way to the future of computing.  What has
microsoft done to be a technological leader?  I posted this question before,
but I got nary a reply.  I make the challenge now to anyone who can come up
with something-especially Microsoft employees.  I get no response this time,
I guess it pretty much assures me that there is none--which is what I
suspect anyway.
