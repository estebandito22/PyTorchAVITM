	I'm trying to install WordPerfect 5.2 for windows on my computer.  I'm
running a 386sx25 w/ 2meg ram and a 4meg virtual mem setting for windows.  I
keep getting errors when I try to run WP52.  It tells me that I don't have
enough memory or disk space (since I have 47megs free on the HD, I'm assuming
that I don't have enough memory).  Can anyone tell me what it takes to run
this beast?  Thanks.
