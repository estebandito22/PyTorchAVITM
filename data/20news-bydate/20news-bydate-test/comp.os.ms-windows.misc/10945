 I just removed an IDE drive and reformated two SCSI disk to use as boot disk 
in a system that did run Windows fine in 386 Enhanced Mode. Its a DX50 with 8 
meg RAM, and an Adaptec 1542b with bios enabled. System runs fine and runs 
Windows in standard mode fine, but it returns to the DOS prompt when trying 
to run 386 mode. I've tried EMMExclude and SysROMBreakPoint. What gives??????

Thanks in advance, Hal
