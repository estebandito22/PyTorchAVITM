I'm using BC++'s ObjectWindows (3.1), trying to resond to the left button
double click message WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK in a combo box. My codes look like:

class MyComboBox : public TComboBox
{
public:
	MyComboBox(PTWindowsObject AParent, int ResourceId, WORD ATextLen) :
		TComboBox(AParent, ResourceId, ATextLen) {};
	virtual void WMLButtonDblClk(RTMessage Msg) = [WM_FIRST + WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK];
};

void MyComboBox::WMLButtonDblClk(RTMessage Msg)
{
	...	// responding to the message (selecting the item in the list box)
}

Anything wrong with my program? Any help would be appreciated.
