By night I'm an Amiga user. By day I work with windows. I'd be much more 
comfortable in windows if I had Two things.

1. A good Personal information manager. You know- a calendar, address book,
reminder list etc... rolled into one clean interface.

2. A good file manager. Microsofts is very poor by my standards. How
about one that has a left and right window and allows file operations 
between them. being able to launch programs from the same interface
would be nice. as well as text reading and graphics viewing. Those
who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm
looking for.

If anyone can steer me towards an FTP sight with these programs it would
make my transition to windows a lot easier. Please reply via email
as I rarely get to read this group. thanks so much!
