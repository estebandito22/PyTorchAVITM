Hello - I am in need of a file viewer for 24 bit TIFF images, to run under
        windows (3.1 if it matters); alternatively a package to run an
        X-server on top of windows would do very well. Unfortunately the
        budget for this is limited so whatever I end up using has to be
        public domain or very inexpensive. Thanks in advance for any help,

        john
