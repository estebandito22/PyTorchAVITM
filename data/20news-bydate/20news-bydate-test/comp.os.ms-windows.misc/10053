Here is another hint:

	I have a really jumping mouse (ps2 type), and finally the mouse
stops jump changing HIMEM.SYS (yes, himem!), is you use:

DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS /M:x

x can be 1,2,...,8 (Of course my computer DON'T appear on the list for
these parameter)

 And maybe, your mouse can stop jump... (But your problem looks more
like a dirty mouse ;)...

	Hope it help (to anybody!)
