I have a 486/33 VLB machine, with a Wang 96/24 fax/modem.
When using the windows terminal application, the only way
I can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to COM2,
then go back and change it to COM4.  Then it works fine.
(I have it set to COM4 as the port to use)  I don't have
anything plugged into COM2, and I've looked over the manual
for all it's worth, but what am I missing?  The modem is 
jumpered for COM4/IRQ3, which I understand means I can't
use the second serial port and the modem at the same time,
but I'm not using the second serial port anyway.
Also, when using Procomm + for DOS, it always sees the modem
and dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other end
answers.  Don't know if that helps any.

Thanks,
