I am running Windows 3.1 on a 386SX-16 MHZ with Five Megs of Memory.

The motherboard came with one meg, and I added the four megs this past
weekend.  They were 1X9 70 Simms.

I had installed in the application menu MS-DOS command PARK.  Up till
today, it parked the disk from the application menu without any problem.

When attempting to park the heads today, I received the following
message:


STOP        This application has violated system integrity due to
            an invalid general protection fault and will be
            terminated.

What does this message mean?

Thanks,
