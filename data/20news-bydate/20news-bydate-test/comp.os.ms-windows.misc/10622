I'd like to get a system running OS/2 2.0 GA talking to a network of PCs
running Windows for Workgroups.  Acting as a server would be wonderful,
but client access would be enough.

Can I run WFW 's NET utilities in a DOS box?  Or is there a way to actually
get OS/2 to talk to WFW?  Will OS/2 LanMan clients talk to WFW?

Dazed and confused,
