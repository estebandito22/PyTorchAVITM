I solved my problem.  I still do not understand why it happens ths
way; perhaps some of you C++ gurus can explain this to all of us!

For some reason when I define the following functins in the class
definition (in the .h file) the compiler thinks some pure virtual
functions are not defined.  When I placed these two in a separate
source file and compiled them, the problem went away.  Any ideas what
happen?  Are the functions that are defined in the class construct all
inline ?  Is this the problem?

virtual int            isEqual (const Object _FAR &obj) const
{ return this == &(HashEntry&) obj; }

virtual void           printOn( Rostream os) const
{
 os << "[ HWindow is " << (void _FAR *) hWindow << " ]\n"; 
}
