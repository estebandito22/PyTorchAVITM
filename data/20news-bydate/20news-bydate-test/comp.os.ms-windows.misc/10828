Well, you can't say that it don't work.  The inability to read 800k mac
disks is not a SW problem.  Rather, it's a HARDWARE limmitation on PCs. 

I have seen a post about a program able to read non-1.44Mb Mac disks,
which comes with a watchamacalit <ma memory's faling> card, which you
just drop into a com port or something.  Don't remember specifics, tho.
