: Well, this is *only* a guess:  If it goes by the "true" meaning of "bit
: map", then it holds (x,y,c) where x pixel number in th ex-direction, y:
: pixel-number in the y-dir, c: colour.

Come on fellows! The format is quite plainly explained in the manuals.
It's in the "Programmer's Reference, Volume 3: Messages, Structures,
and Macros" (MSC-Dev.kit for 3.1, should be also in the Borland's
manuals) pages 232-241 (depending what you need).

First there is the BITMAPFILEHEADER-struct then the BITMAPINFO which
contains the BITMAPINFOHEADER and the RGBQUAD and then the bitmap
data. AND there is also a example among the example files (MS_SDK).
Hope this helps....

If it's possible that there are some opinions above, they must be all MINE.
