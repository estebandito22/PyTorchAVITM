	The best one I've seen is CEO, by Sloop Software.  They have a
	sharware version, but the retail version is only $40-50.  It's
	incredibly complete, subfolders to any level, choose any icon,
	hot keys, drop down menus, button bars, etc.  Haven't found
	anything it doesn't do.  Try mailing 72540.144@compuserve.com
	for details.

	Tom
