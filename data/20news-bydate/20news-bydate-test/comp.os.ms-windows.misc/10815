You're right.

You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II 800K 3.5" disk or Apple II
5.25" disk without extra hardware. However, Mac 1.44MB disks can be read
and written in a PC 3.5" HD drive with software only. 

This should probably be added to every PC and Mac FAQ file. It sure gets
asked enough.
