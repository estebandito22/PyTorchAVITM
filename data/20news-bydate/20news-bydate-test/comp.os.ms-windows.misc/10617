Last night I tried to reinstall the utilities from the Windows 3.1 Resource
Kit disk. The setup program appeared to run perfectly normally, but when it
had finished, there was no Program Group created. Now, I know I've done
this before successfully, and creating a group myself didn't exactly tax
me, but I'm curious as to what might be going on. I can only assume that
something left over from the last time I had it installed is getting in 
the way, but I can't figure out what. Any clues, anyone?
