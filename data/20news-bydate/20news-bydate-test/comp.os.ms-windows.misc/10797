Autodesk Animator is a good tool. The one I like is Show Partner/FX. If
you want it, I could give a copy to you. I did a lot of advertising with it -
it lets you create both graphics (ANY resolution) and text frames, run it all
as a "film", you can make choices and include music - I guess that's just
what you need. If you're really interested, email me.
