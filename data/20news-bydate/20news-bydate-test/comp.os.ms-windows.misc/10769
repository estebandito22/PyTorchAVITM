I am running windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode.  The sound card I have
is the ATI Stereo F/X-CD sound card which claims Adlib and Soundblaster
compatibility.

Using Windows MediaPlayer, I can play the midi files that came with
my sound card.  However, I can't play any of the midi files that belong
to the WinJammer midi editor that I ftp'd from cica.  I also can't
play any midi files I generate with muzika (also from cica).  When I
try to play the files, a dialog box pops up saying that the music
may not play right, and it has a checkbox asking me if i wish to disable
this message in the future.

Is this normal, or do I have something set wrong?  I would really like
to be able to write music on muzika and have my computer play it.

I also ftp'd the game dare2dream for windows (from cica) and its music
won't play either - I get the same dialog box.

The MIDI Mappers that I have are ATI Ext MIDI, ATI OPL3 MIDI, and Vanilla.
I have tried using all three.

Any help, suggestions, shoulders to cry on, etc. would be appreciated
very much.

John P.
