We are searching for one or two instructors for tutorials on advanced
Windows programming under NT.  If anyone has attended a course that was
very good, we would really appreciate recommendations.

Please email me directly at paller@fedunix.org; I don't get to see these
newsgroups often enough.

Thanks in advance for any help.
