Why is Win 3.1 sometimes so finicky?
I have a new DELL 486DX2/66mhz  8 megs RAM.
Windows was working just great.  I had a Bus mouse and mother board problem.
DELL replaced the mouse, gave me a newer mouse driver for windows
and replaced the motherboard.  Just prior to this problem windows would
]only load up every other time.  I would get the LOGO and either it would
go on into windows or LOCK UP.  This was very consistent EVERY OTHER TIME.

Now with the new motherboard and all, it still does the same thing.
The computer is less than one month old.  At first it worked FINE!
I can get into windows each time now with the   win/s command.
This forces Standard mode.  Things seem to run slower.  I mainly
use windows apps, but in standard mode there is no virtual mem.....
plus it is slower.

I re-loaded windows, it still does the same thing.  Should I first delete
everything in all windows dir's?  I did not because I have so much 
added in sub dir's etc.

Really puzzling why ENHANCED MODE would not load each time but consistently
every other time.  Standard mode each time......

ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS ???
