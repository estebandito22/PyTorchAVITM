Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate
spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and
characters on each side, which is useless.

I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183).
This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel
font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183
character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.
Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font
graphics displayed however!!

Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character? 

Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF?
