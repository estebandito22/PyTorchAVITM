A friend and I have ATI Graphic Ultra display adaptors, and they have
been reasonably good performers, but we both have had irritating compatibility
problems with the ATI drivers and are ready to change to something faster
and more compatible with windows. I have heard rumblings that the new Orchid
9000 card is very fast. Anyone have experience with this card? What is
currently available that is fast, compatible, does 1280x1024x256 non-
interlaced and cost under $500?
