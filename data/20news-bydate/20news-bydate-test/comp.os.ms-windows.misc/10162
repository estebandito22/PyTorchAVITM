Please don't post uuencoded bitmaps here.  If you want to do so, put them
in the alt.binaries.* areas.  These files are very large and may crash
some users newsfeeds.  It's also a waste of band width.  Also, we all
know how to convert .gif to .bmp with many programs so it'd really not
worth posting all of these .bmp files.
 - thanks
