This sounds like what happened to my HD a month ago. My HD was stacked
with Stacker v.2.0 (I run Dos5) Suddenly everything hung up, and most of
the HD got corrupted (directories changed into unreadable files with
'funny' names). In other words: it is probably just the doubledisk part of
Dos6 that is troublesome. 

I now use Stacker v 3.0, and so far I have had no trouble.
