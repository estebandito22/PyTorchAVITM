I am getting desperate. I have a report that must be finished by midnight,
and W4W doesn't seem to have what appears to be a MUST! I use the autonum
field for numbering chapters, but my document is distributed amongst
several files. I just can't find a way to make Word start the numbering
at something else than 0 or 1. Of course, everything is fine in the first
file, but it's pretty stupid when ALL chapters are numbered as 1 !!!!!!!!

Please, if you have ANY solution to this (except from putting it all in
one 10M document ...) e-mail me immediately !
As I am working on th report I hardly have any time to read News, so
please e-mail me. All answers will be heartly welcome ...

In advance, thanx a lot !!!!!!
