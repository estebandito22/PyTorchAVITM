Please Help if you can. Whenever I try to run windows useing the 16
million color mode with the drivers supplyed with my Diamond Stelth 24x
It will lock up requireing a full system reset to break out. The drivers
that I have for windows are V.1.00 for windows 3.1 (which IS the version
of windows I am useing)

My Setup
---------
386DX40 128KCach
4 Megs of ram
14" SVGA touch Monitor non-interlaced
AMI Bios

Any and all help would be apreciated, The card seems to work fine in other
modes, I usually run windows in 800x600 mode and probs at all, so I am
hopeing it is a driver and not a card problem.
