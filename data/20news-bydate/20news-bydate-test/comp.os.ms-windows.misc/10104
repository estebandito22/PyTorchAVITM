Hi,

	I've got an older 386/25 motherboard (old as in, uses a 1988
keyboard controller, and uses memory interleaving rather than caching).
It has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause
the machine to lock up (reset button required), but only when in 386
enhanced mode.  This occurs in Norton Desktop, File Manager, and when
trying to install software.  Running Win 3.1 in standard mode works fine.

	Has anyone run into this?  Any ideas?  Much thanks appreciated.
