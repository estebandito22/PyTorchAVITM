You are pervert.. Ok vi is not CUA but it has a powerful set of commands.
One for all it has 26 separate clipboard (and not only one ofor all kind of
data like Windows does).
The only problem is to Know the commands (the keyboard shortcut).
I am quite fast with the pc keyboard... and I usually use all fingers to digit
so when I use a editor I do not want to leave the keyboard and use the mouse
every time I need a special Function on the menu or to use the arrow keys
that are away from the usual position of my hands on the keyboard......
In my situation vi is very powerful and I'm searching to a vi editor 
for Windows....
Bye
p.s. sorry for the bad english....
