I've got an old Super VGA card manufactured by SAMPO of Taiwan and I'm
looking for a Windows 3.1 Driver for it.  It's based on the Cirrus Logic
CL-GD510A-32PC-B chip.  I've contacted the suppliers here in New Zealand
and they say that only Windows 2 divers were ever written by the manufacturer.
So if there's a V3.1 driver out for this chip set I'd like to know - 
preferably by e-mail at rjwjames@waikato.ac.nz
                     
Thanks is advance

Ross James
