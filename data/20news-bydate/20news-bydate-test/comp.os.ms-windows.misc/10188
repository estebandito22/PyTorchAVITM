Subject: PostScript to BMP conversion
Lines: 13

 Hi All.

 I am working on a project in visual basic ver. 2.0 and I need to show
 PostCript files I am getting from another aplication.
 So, because i can't show PostScript directly form Visual Basic (at least I
 don't know how), i need a utility to convert them to BMP, WMF.

 Any help will be appreshieated.
