I'm looking for any information regarding Text Search Engines...  Specifically,
I'd prefer source or binaries which will run in a MS-Windows and/or UNIX
environment scanning either flat files or common DB structures...

References to PD, Shareware, or Commercial implementations welcome...

Please reply via email -- I'll summarize if desired.

Thanx !
