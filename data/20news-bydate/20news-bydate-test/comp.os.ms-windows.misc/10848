It will certainly *help* to be able to run Windows and Dos apps but
the only way that Solaris or OS/2 or any other scheme is going to 
challenge Microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for Solaris
or OS/2 or whatever apps, down to a DOS competitive level.  Everybody
would rather run a Solaris app on a Solaris system and an OS/2 app on
an OS/2 system, they usually just can't afford a Unix system because
of the high prices for good Unix software.
