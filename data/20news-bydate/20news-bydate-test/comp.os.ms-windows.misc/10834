IT'S BACK!!!!!!

Congratulations, you've just discovered a very nasty, and very frequently
ecountered, bug in the Word Setup program. Once you know what is wrong, it
is quite easy to fix. Go into the Fonts dialog under Control Panel, and select
the two fonts MT Extra and Fences. Delete them, but only delete the list
entries, not the disk files. Now select Add, and add the fonts MT Extra Plain
and Fences Plain. Close the Font box, close Control Panel, and restart Word.
Everything should be alright now.

Does anyone know if Microsoft has fixed this thing yet? They HAVE to know
about it by now, it's been so frequently reported.
