A friend of mine uses Windows 3.1 to do most of her work.
Unfortunately, she has very bad eyesight, and we haven't
been able to figure out how to change the default font
used by the system and application menus, or the font used
by the Help program (what use is hypertext if you can't
read it?) to make it legible to her.

If anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts,
of any software package that makes Windows more accessible
to visually handicapped people, please let me know.

Thanks,
	Dan
