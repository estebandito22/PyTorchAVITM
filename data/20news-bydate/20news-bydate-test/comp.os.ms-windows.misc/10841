I think you're deliberatly overstating the requirements for OS/2.  
Considering that OS/2 is a multi-threaded true multitasking OS and
takes the place of DOS and Windows and more, I actually think the 
requirements for OS/2 are very reasoable.  I also think that anyone
using Windows 3.1 without 8 megs of RAM, a 386-40, and 200 megs of
hard drive space, is beating their head against a wall.  Those are
also legitimate requirements for OS/2.  In fact, the requirements 
for Windows 3.1 and OS/2 are about equal.
