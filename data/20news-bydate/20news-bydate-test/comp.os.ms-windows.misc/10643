   I am setting up my DOS/UNIX box on a 116M IDE and a 412M SCSI drive
and was wondering about the use of the (MS-DOS 5.0) JOIN command.  I
like the way it sets things up since I won't have to stick with the C:
D: & E: (crap) that DOS enforces.  I like how it would mimic mount
points of UNIX filesystems.  I have heard that there were problems
with using it, or at least under older versions of DOS.  Please tell!
