I am working with Visual Basic v2.0 for windows.
Specifically, I am working on an application that generates formatted reports.
Since, some of these reports can be rather large, my first question is:

1.  Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in
Visual Basic/windows beyond the 64k limit?

As I have not (as yet - being optimistic :-) come across a way to get
around the above problem, I am working on the following approach:

I am trying to create my own defined template in MS-Word, using the
WordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual Basic(VB) and load
this template of mine, which will work in the following way:

It will first open MyOwn.INI file (created in VB - at the time when the
user selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the
.INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then
open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .INI file.

1.  When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic, is there a way
to specify/change the default .INI file (which is win.ini) to MyOwn.INI file?

2. When using the file Input$ function in WordBasic - is there a way to
read more than the 32k at one time?

Any help will be appreciated.
