Sorry about confusing subject/summary/keywords!!!

I am a postgrad researcher in ESL/applied linguistics at Edith Cowan
University in Perth Western Australia...

I DESPERATELY need help!!! I need to record the results of word
processing sessions in windows - so that I can sit down and replay the
results of my research subjects' wordprocessing behaviours -
naturally, I can do this with the Windows macrorecorder - and 2 or 3
other apps in windows - BUT I CANNOT PAUSE/RESUME!!!! - i.e. all I can
do is to ctrl/break to get out - this is useless for a researcher who
needs to be able to pause the wordprocessing session he is replaying
to make notes/annotations - and then RESUME from where he left off...

I am just about to commence my research for my Masters thesis and
would be EXTREMELY grateful for any assistance - if anyone can help
could they mail me at:

johnoliver@odin.DIALix.oz.au

Many thanks in advance...

John Oliver
