   I have been using WinQVT/Net 2.81 under Win3.1 (dos 5.0) for quite
sometime without any problem.  I recently installed DOS 6.0 on my 386-40 PC
and I cannot run WinQVT/Net any more.  I keep getting "Packet received for
invalid port-reset sent" messages on the console window.  I can't
get more than 1 telnet window and can't use ftp!!!

   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

   Thanks,
