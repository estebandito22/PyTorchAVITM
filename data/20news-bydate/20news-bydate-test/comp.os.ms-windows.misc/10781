What version of WinFAX do you have?  The newest version (3.0) has an OCR
(Optical Character Recognition) built in... what this means is that it can
take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ASCII so that one can edit
the document w/o re-typing it... However, I found that the OCR that comes
packaged with WINFAX does not work as well as OMNIpage Professional (also
by Delrina software)... So, once again, WinFAX ver. 3.0 has what you are
looking for... Good luck!
