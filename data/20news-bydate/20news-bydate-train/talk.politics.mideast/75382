  This is the latest from UPI 

     Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told journalists Turkey was
     closing its air space to all flights to and from Armenia and would
     prevent humanitarian aid from reaching the republic overland across
     Turkish territory.

  
   Historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited 
   signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian
   populations. Even the Nazis did this much.

   It seems as though from now on Turkey will publicly pronounce 
   themselves 'hypocrites' should they choose to continue their
   condemnation of the Serbians.
