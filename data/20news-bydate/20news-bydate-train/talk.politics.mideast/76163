The Armenians were deeply anti-semitic as well. In the May 10, 1936 
edition of 'Hairenik Weekly' the vice-mayor of Bucharest, Rumania is 
quoted as saying:

"The Armenians helped us not to become the slaves of the Jewish
 elements in our country."

In another edition, an author named Captain George Haig writes:

"And the type of Jew who is imported to Palestine...is not anything
 to be proud about. Their loose morals, and other vices were
 unknown to the Arabs prior to Balfour Declaration, on top of 
 all communist activities were the cause of most of the Arab
 criticism."[1]

As Uzun exposed, the Armenians were fascist. Before Pearl Harbor, 
the Dashnak daily 'Hairenik' (not to be confused with the Tzeghagrons
'Hairenik Weekly') expressed pro-Nazi sentiments:

"And came Adolf Hitler, after herculean struggles. He spoke
 to the racial heart strings of the German, opened the 
 fountain of his national genius, strock down the spirit
 of defeatism...At no period since the World War had Berlin
 conducted so realistic, well organized, and planned policy
 as now, since Hitler's assumption to power...And whatever
 others may think concerning Hitlerism and Fascism as a 
 system of Government, it is proved that they have revitalized
 and regenerated the two states, Germany and Italy."[2]

                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks 
                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists 
                            a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)
