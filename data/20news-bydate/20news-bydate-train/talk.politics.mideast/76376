It wasn't all that long ago that the acts of Israeli soldiers were
described as "superhuman".  Now, they are "inhuman".  Did the Israelis
change so radically so quickly or have reporting attitudes changed?

When the Jews were powerless, they did what they could to help others,
which was obviously quite limited.  Later, liberated American Jews
were on the forefront of the civil-rights movement.  The Jewish
government of Israel rescued Jews ranging in skin color from White
Russian to Brown Yemenite to Black Ethiopian.  Please, Andi, tell us
"how the Jews are treating other races when they got power."

Your ignorance and bias are indeed unfortunate.
