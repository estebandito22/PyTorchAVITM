[DG] THE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM: A COSTLY AND DANGEROUS MISTAKE
[DG] by Theodore J. O'Keefe
[DG] HARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, within clear view of the Jefferson
[DG] Memorial, an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial,
[DG] has arisen, on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States of
[DG] America, a costly and dangerous mistake.  On ground where no monument yet
[DG] marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all
[DG] races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today a
[DG] massive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and false
[DG] version of the ordeal in Europe during World War II, of non-American
[DG] members of a minority, sectarian group.  Now, in the deceptive guise of
[DG] tolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda
[DG] campaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,
[DG] in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.

[JAKE] After reading the first paragraph, a quick scan confirmed my first
[JAKE] impression: this is a bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash.

Jake, I'm really disappointed in you. It took you a whole paragraph
to see that it was "bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash". :-)

The article title "THE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM: A COSTLY AND 
DANGEROUS MISTAKE" should have been enough! :-)
