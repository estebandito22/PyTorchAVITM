It's hard to beat a car-bomb with a suicidal driver in getting 
right up to the target before blowing up.  Even booby-traps and
radio-controlled bombs under cars are pretty efficient killers.  
You have a point.

Is this part of your Islamic value-system?

Had Israeli methods been anything like this, then Iraq wouldn've been
nuked long ago, entire Arab towns deported and executions performed by
the tens of thousands.  The fact is, though, that Israeli methods
aren't even 1/10,000th as evil as those which are common and everyday
in Arab states.

"Israeli soil"????  Brad/Ali!  Just wait until the Ayatollah's
thought-police get wind of this.  It's all "Holy Muslim Soil (tm)".
Have you forgotten?  May Allah have mercy on you now.
