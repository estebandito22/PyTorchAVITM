With regards to my condemnation of Marc's ridiculous attacks on the
American Department of Justice, and further attacks on Jews, to
anyone who took offense to my calling Marc stupid, I
apologize for pointing out the obvious.  It was a waste of the
Net's time.  I hope, though, that most American citizens have
the basic knowlege of the structure of American government to
understand the relationship between the Justice Department
as a part of the Executive Branch, and the Courts, which
are of the Judicial Branch.  
Marc's ignorance of basic civic knowlege underscores his
inability to comprehend and interpret foreign affairs.  


Peace,
Pete
