And anyone who doesn't agree with you is, by your own definitions, a
"useless fart".  Just like any text that disputes your own "findings"
is always described as "flawed" or "biased".  In other words, you
trumpet the things you like and dismiss those that might embarass you.
We've seen you play these games here for a long time.

One thing is for sure: When it comes to "useless farts", you sure know 
what you're talking about.
