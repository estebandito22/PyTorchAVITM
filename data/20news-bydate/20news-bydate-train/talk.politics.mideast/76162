Atrocity Reports Horrify Azerbaijan :

"Azeri officials who returned from the seen to this town about nine miles 
 away brought back three dead children, the backs of their heads blown off...
 'Women and children had been scalped,' said Assad Faradzev, an aide to 
 Karabagh's Azeri governor.  Azeri television showed pictures of one 
 truckload of bodies brought to the Azeri town of Agdam, some with their 
 faces apparently scratched with knives or their eyes gouged out."

"Journalists in the area reported seeing dozens of corpses, including some 
 of the civilians, and Azerbaijani officials said Armenians began shooting 
 at them when they sought to recover the bodies."
