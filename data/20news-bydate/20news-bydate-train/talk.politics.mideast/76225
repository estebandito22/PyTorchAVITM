	I have just started reading the articles in this news
group. There seems to be an attempt by some members to quiet
other members with scare tactics. I believe one posting said
that all postings by one person are being forwarded to his
server who keeps a file on him in hope that "Appropriate action
might be taken". 
	I don't know where you guys are from but in America
such attempts to curtail someones first amendment rights are
not appreciated. Here, we let everyone speak their mind
regardless of how we feel about it. Take your fascistic
repressive ideals back to where you came from.
