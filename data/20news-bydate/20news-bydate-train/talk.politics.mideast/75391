(just an interrupting comment here) Since EARLY 1980's , israelis said they are 
willing to give up the Adminstration rule of the occupied terretories to
Palestineans. Palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that denies
them their right of SELF-DETERMINATION. period.

Ok. I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However,
i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who
have the right for it.

As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the
current negotiations and the so-called peace process, they
are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions
that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same
for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of "negotiations" in Madrid,
and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.
I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have to
loose ?

Arabs feel that the current "negotiations" is ONLY for legitimizing the current
status-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and
"oranges". That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked. 

Just an opinion.
