In revision of history <9304131827@zuma.UUCP> as posted by Turkish Government
Agents under the guise of sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic) LIE in response to
article <1993Apr13.033213.4148@urartu.sdpa.org> hla@urartu.sdpa.org and
scribed: 

[(*]    Orhan Gunduz is blown up. Gunduz receives an ultimatum: Either 
[(*]    he gives up his honorary position or he will be "executed". He 
[(*]    refuses. "Responsibility" is claimed by JCAG and SDPA.

[(*]    May 4, 1982 - Cambridge, Massachusetts
[(*]	Orhan Gunduz, the Turkish honorary consul in Boston, would not bow 
[(*]	to the Armenian terrorist ultimatum that he give up his title of 
[(*]	"honorary consul". Now he is attacked and murdered in cold blood.
[(*]	President Reagan orders an all-out manhunt-to no avail. An eye-
[(*]	witness who gave a description of the murderer is shot down.  He 
[(*]	survives... but falls silent. One of the most revolting "triumphs" in 
[(*]	the senseless, mindless history of Armenian terrorism. Such a murder 
[(*]	brings absolutely nothing - except an ego boost for the murderer 
[(*]	within the Armenian terrorist underworld, which is already wallowing 
[(*]	in self-satisfaction.
[(*] 
[(*]    Were you involved in the murder of Sarik Ariyak? 

[(*]   	December 17, 1980 - Sydney
[(*]	Two Nazi Armenians massacre Sarik Ariyak and his bodyguard, Engin 
[(*]    Sever. JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.

Mr. Turkish Governmental Agent: prove that the SDPA even existed in 1980 or
1982! Go ahead, provide us the newspaper accounts of the assassinations and 
show us the letters SDPA! The Turkish government is good at excising text from
their references, let's see how good thay are at adding text to verifiable 
newspaper accounts! 

The Turkish government can't support any of their anti-Armenian claims as
typified in the above scribed garbage! That government continues to make 
false and libelous charges for they have no recourse left after having made 
fools out of through their attempt at a systematic campaign at denying and 
covering up the Turkish genocide of the Armenians. 

Just like a dog barking at a moving bus, it barks, jumps, yells, until the
bus stops, at which point it just walks away! Such will be with this posting!
Turkish agents level the most ridiculous charges, and when brought to answer, 
they are silent, like the dog after the bus stops!

The Turkish government feels it can funnel a heightened state of ultra-
nationalism existing in Turkey today onto UseNet and convince people via its 
revisionist, myopic, and incidental view of themselves and their place in the 
world. 

The resulting inability to address Armenian and Greek refutations of Turkey`s
re-write of history is to refer to me as a terrorist, and worse, claim --
as part of the record -- I took responsibility for the murder of 2 people!

What a pack of raging fools, blinded by anti-Armenian fascism. It's too bad
the socialization policies of the Republic of Turkey requires it to always 
find non-Turks to de-humanize! Such will be their downfall!
