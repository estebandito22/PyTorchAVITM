In the United States we refer to it as Freedom of Speech. If you don't like 
what I write either prove me wrong, shut up, or simply fade away! 

[KAAN] Didn't you hear the saying "DON'T MESS WITH A TURC!!"...

No. Why do you ask? What are you going to do? Are you going to submit me to
bodily harm? Are you going to kill me? Are you going to torture me?

[KAAN] See ya in hell..

Don't kill the messenger!
