As usual, when Salah is not totally racist, she manages to get
virtually all the facts wrong.

Assad pledged to allow Jews to leave Syria, but not to go to Israel.

Unfortunately, not all of them have escaped yet, but not because they
don't want to leave;  rather, Assad went back on his word and stopped
issuing travel permits.  He claimed bureaucratic snags, but everyone
knows it was a tactic to pressure Israel.
