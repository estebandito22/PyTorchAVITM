Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin
or in Sabra and Shatila? If so then let me tell you some good jokes:

There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII

Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more.

In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.

People die that is all. No one gets killed.

Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american
napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all.

Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they 
may be thought it was like snifing cocaine. No?

What do you think of this ? Isn't it stupid to say so?
Well it is as stupid as what you said .Next time you want to lie do it
intelligently.

Sincerely yours.

Hassan
