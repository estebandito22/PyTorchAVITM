Sorry, ARF - you dog,

That news was suppressed because the Israeli national volleyball team
repeatedly spiked it.

Let this be a lesson to others not to invoke the wrath of sports nuts.
(Brits lead the way in this regard, with ~220 casualties in the last 2
years.)

Anyway, Yigal would never sue.  His life is (presumably) so pristine
that its most intimate details could be revealed without harm to
anyone.  Might even be good instruction for some people I can think of.

Me, I _would_ sue!  I hate the way sports dominates the media.
Anyway, the last 3 ADL agents watching me die of boredom before filing
their reports.  I've damaged their Atlanta operation something fierce.
