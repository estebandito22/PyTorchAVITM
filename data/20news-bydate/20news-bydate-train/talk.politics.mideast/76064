If you want info claiming that blacks were brought to earth 60 trillion
years ago by Aliens from the plante Shabazz, I can send you literature from
the Nation of Islam (Farrakhan's group) who believe this.

If you want info claiming that the Holocaust never happened, I can send you
info from IHR (Institute for Historical Review - David Irving's group), or
just read Dan Gannon's posts on alt.revisionism.

I just wanted to put Steve's post in with the company that it deserves.
