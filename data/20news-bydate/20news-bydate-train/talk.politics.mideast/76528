OY] Henrik (?),
OY] Your ignorance manifests itself in an awkward form of intransigence. I'm not
OY] going to spend time to review with you the recent history of Cyprus. 

	Good !! Go back to your references and read it over and over ...

OY] If you are really interested, I can provide you with a number of references
OY] on the issue.  Just send me EMail for that.  

	You think I am that STUPID to ask you for REFERENCES !  NOT !
	I have many GREEK friends that I could ask for the INFO if I
	needed. I have already read many articles and DO NOT need
	your help. Boy, how generous !!

OY] Relax! You're swinging fists into open air... I was *agreeing* with you,
OY] assuming that would be one of your points that you did not state! You may 
OY] not be very much used to it, to be agreed with - that is, but take it more
OY] easily.  !:-)

	Believe me, I am so relaxed ...

henrik]     However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane 
henrik]     to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one

[OY] 	No, Henrik, believe me: You don't hope that.

	  IF Armenia is goint to do that, then so be it.
  
henrik]         that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
henrik]         (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.

OY] Was that after or before one French plane changed its route to avoid
OY] inspection??? 

	All I am saying is that the plane that was SEARCHED was an
	AMERICAN and why Turkey DID NOT TRUST the U.S. that it was
        mainly HUMANITARIAN AID CARGO.
