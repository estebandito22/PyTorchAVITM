The wars of 1948, 1956, 1967, 1978 were definitely started by the Arabs.
The war in 1982 was instigated by the Arabs who continually murdered
Israeli children with their rocket attacks.  Israel was only trying to
stop this.  
Last what the heck are you talking about with "1968 (Karama)"?  There was 
no war in 1968!
