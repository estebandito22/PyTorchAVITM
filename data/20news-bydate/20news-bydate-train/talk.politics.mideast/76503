The problem if  transffering US government files about Yigal Arens
and some other similar persons does or does not violate a federal
or a local American law seemed to belong to some local american law
forum  not to this forum.
The readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents
of those files.
So It will be nice if Yigal will tell us:
1. Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous?
2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ?
3. If one does trust either the US government or the ADL what an
   additional information should he send them ?
