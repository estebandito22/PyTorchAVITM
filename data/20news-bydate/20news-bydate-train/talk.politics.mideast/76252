  And why are we in Somalia?   When right across the Gulf of Aden are
  some of the wealthiest Arab nations on the planet?  Why does the 
  US always become the point man for this stuff?   I don't mind us
  helping out; but what invariably happens is that everybody expects
  us to do most of the work and take most of the risks, even when these
  events are occuring in other people's back yards, and they have the
  resources to deal with them quite well, thank you.  I mean, it's 
  not like either Serbia, or Somalia represent some overwhelming
  military force that their neighbors can't handle.  Nor are the 
  logistics a big deal -- it's a lot bigger logistical challenge 
  to get troops and supplies from New York to Somalia, than from 
  Saudi Arabia; harder to go from Texas to Serbia, than Turkey or 
  Austria to Serbia.
