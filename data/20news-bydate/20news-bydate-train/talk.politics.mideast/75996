I recently read that during Bill Clinton's campaign, he stated
that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital.  According to the article, Mr. Clinton
reaffirmed this after winning the presidency.  However,
during recent talks with President Mubarak, Secretary of
State Christopher stated that "the status of Jerusalem
will be a final matter of discussion between the parties".

Now I don't want to start a big discussion over the status
of Jerusalem.  All I want to know is if anyone can 
authenticate Mr. Clinton's statements with dates, places, etc.

Thank you.

Ben.
