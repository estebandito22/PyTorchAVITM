Would it be asking too much for you to DOCUMENT these allegations of
"Israel used to arrest and kill neutral reporters"? I think you confuse
Israel with other nations of that geographical region to which the notion
of a free, unmonitored by the government, press corps would be a joke.

As for the notion that Israel threatens the human rights of Palestinians by
sealing off the Gaza strip, get real. When the Palestinian-on-Palestinian
civil war stops and all Palestinians can behave like mature human beings,
Israel will talk concessions on both sides for peace. Not before.
