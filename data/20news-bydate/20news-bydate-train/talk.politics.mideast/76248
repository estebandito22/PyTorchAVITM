Uh Oh!  The first sign of an argument without merit--the stating of one's 
"qualifications" in an area.  If you know something about Nazi Germany, 
show it.  If you don't, shut up.  Simple as that.

ALL Jews suffered during WWII, not just our beloved who perished or were 
tortured.  We ALL suffered.  Second, the name-calling was directed against
YOU, not civil-libertarians in general.  Your name-dropping of a fancy
sounding political term is yet another attempt to "cite qualifications" 
in order to obfuscate your glaring unpreparedness for this argument.  Go 
back to the minors, junior.
