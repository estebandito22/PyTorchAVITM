pl: 1.  So, did the Turks kill the Armenians?

ac: So, did the Jews kill the Germans? 
ac: You even make Armenians laugh.

ac: "An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the
ac: systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of 
ac: the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at 
ac: least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The 
ac: memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and 
ac: eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in
ac: 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound."

Typical Mutlu.  PvdL asks if X happened, the response is that Y
happened.  Even if we grant that the Armenians *did* do what Cosar
accuses them of doing, this has no bearing on whether the Turks did
what they are accused of.

While I can understand how an AI could be this stupid, I
can't understand how a human could be such a moron as to either let
such an AI run amok or to compose such pointless messages himself.

I do not expect any followup to this article from Argic to do anything
to alleviate my puzzlement.  But maybe I'll see a new line from his
list of insults.
