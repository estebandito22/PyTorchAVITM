Hey Serdar,
           What nationality are you anyway? You are the supreme geek of
geekdom of the usenet. You are laeding a totally useless and futile life on
your computer Mr. Wimpy. You are the epitamy of a coward.I can predict that
you will spend the rest of your useless, wastefull and pitifull life on the
Usenet.  What a wasted life.
