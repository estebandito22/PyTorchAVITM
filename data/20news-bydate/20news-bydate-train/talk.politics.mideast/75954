Actually, this is incorrect.  French resistance may have played some
part in hindering the German war effort, however the crucial role was
supplied on D-Day.

Interesting statement.  Especially when you consider that Lebanon
had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks, as well as
Israel.  Of course, one of the prime obstacles to Israel's complete
withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied
to the area as well as the large presence of Syrian forces which
have not been asked to withdraw as well.
