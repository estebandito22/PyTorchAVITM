I do (did) contribute to the ARF mortgage fund but when interest
rates plumetted, I just paid it off.

The problem is, I couldn't convince Congress to move my home to 
a nicer location on Federal land.

BTW, even though the building is alleged to be funded by tax exempt
private funds, the maintainence and operating costs will be borne by 
taxpayers forever.

Would anyone like to guess how much that will come to and tell us why
this point is never mentioned?
