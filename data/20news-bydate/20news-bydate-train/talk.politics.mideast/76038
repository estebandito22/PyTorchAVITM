[JLE] Q: How many occupying israeli soldiers (terrorists) does it
[JLE] take to kill a 5 year old native child?
[JLE] A: Four
[JLE] Two fasten his arms, one shoots in the face,
[JLE] and one writes up a false report.

A couple of months ago JLE wrote a terrible C program (it would never have 
passed compilation). This is one describes JLE the Great.

---- 8< Cut Here and save to jle.c ----------- >8 ----------

#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

#define	LOSER		0x01
#define	CHILDISH	0x01
#define	UNHUMORISTIC	0x01
#define VULGAR		0x01
#define MOSSAD_AGENT	0x01

#define J_L_E		LOSER | CHILDISH | UNHUMORISTIC | VULGAR | MOSSAD_AGENT

static void
abort()
{
	printf("Even if she wanted, JLE's mother couldn't abort this program");
	printf("\n\n\n\n");
}

void
main()
{
	signal(SIGINT,abort);
	printf("This program does not help Jewish-Arab relations  :-( \n");

	printf("Hit ^C to abort \n");

/* Infinite loop, JLE never comes out of his world 	*/

	while(J_L_E);
}

To compile this "wonderfool" program on a unix machine try.
cc -o jle jle.c
or 
make jle

then type jle at your prompt.

I tried it, it works great ...
