henrik] Let me clearify Mr. Turkish;
henrik] ARMENIA is NOT getting "itchy". SHE is simply LETTING the WORLD KNOW 
henrik] that SHE WILL NO  LONGER sit there QUIET and LET TURKS get away with 
henrik] their FAMOUS tricks. Armenians DO REMEMBER of the TURKISH invasion 
henrik] of the Greek island of CYPRESS WHILE the world simply WATCHED. 

Onur Yalcin] It is more appropriate to address netters with their names as 
Onur Yalcin] they appear in their signatures (I failed to do so since you did 
Onur Yalcin] not bother to sign your posting). Not only because it is the 
Onur Yalcin] polite thing to do, but also to avoid addressing ladies with 
Onur Yalcin] "Mr.", as you have done.

	Fine. Please, accept my opology !

Onur Yalcin] Secondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled 
Onur Yalcin] as Cyprus has never been Greek, but rather, it has been home to 
Onur Yalcin] a bi-communal society formed of Greeks and Turks. It seems that 
               ^^^^^^^^^^^
Onur Yalcin] you know as little about the history and the demography of the 
Onur Yalcin] island, as you know about the essence of Turkey's 
Onur Yalcin] military intervention to it under international agreements.

	bi-communal society ? Then why DID NOT Greece INVADE CYPRUS ? 
	
Onur Yalcin] Be that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in 
Onur Yalcin] history and what is going on today on Azerbaijani land, can only 
Onur Yalcin] be drawn with the expansionist policy that Armenia is now pursuing.

	Buch of CRAP and you know it. Nagarno-Karabagh has ALWAYS been PART 
        of ARMENIA and it was STALIN who GAVE IT to the AZERIS. Go back and
        review the HISTORY.  

	The Armenians in Nagarno-Karabagh are simply DEFENDING their RIGHTS
        to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are INVADING their 
        teritory.

Onur Yalcin] But, I could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to 
Onur Yalcin] the political conduct of countries, and promulgate them in such 
Onur Yalcin] terminology as "itchy-bitchy"... 

       I was not the one that STATED IT. 
	
       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane 
       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.
