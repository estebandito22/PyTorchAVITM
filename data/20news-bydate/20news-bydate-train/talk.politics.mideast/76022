Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan.  It is Armenian
soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan.
You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression
only in that region.  It seems to me that the Armenians are better
organized, have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns
repeatedly.  

I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion.  Turkey had the right to
intervene, and it did.  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to
last for so long, but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both
on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed
for the ongoing standoff in the region.  

Lastly, why is there not a soc.culture.armenia?  I vote yes for it.
After all, it is now free.
