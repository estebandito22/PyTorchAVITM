Anas Omran writes in his earlier posting:

[ANAS] A high rank Israeli officer was killed during a clash whith a Hamas
[ANAS] Mujahid.  The terrorist Israelis chased and killed a young Mujahid
[ANAS] using anti-tank missiles.  The terrorist zionists cut the Mujahid's
[ANAS] body into small pieces to the extend that his body was not recognized.
[ANAS] At leat ten houses were destroyed by these atni-tank missiles.

If indeed Israeli soldiers killed a "Hamas Mujahid" with an anti-tank missile
then I'm almost sure that the "terrorist zionists" would not have been able
to cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the missile.

Stop polluting the net with you fantasies.
