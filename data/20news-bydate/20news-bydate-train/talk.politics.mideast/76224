	First let me correct myself in that it was Goerbels and
not Goering (Airforce) who ran the Nazi propaganda machine. I
agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But I
believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the
american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli
accounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that the
Israelis had more motivation for bias.
	The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its
gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most
such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often
the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and
Israel). It is also interesting to note that that means
other western countries realize these human rights violations.
So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.
