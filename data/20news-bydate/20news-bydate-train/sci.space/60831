> Portugese launch complex were *wonderful

Portuguese launch complex??? Gosh.... Polish are for American in the 
same way as Portuguese are for Brazilians (I am from Brazil). There is 
a joke about the Portuguese Space Agency that wanted to send a 
Portuguese  astronaut to the surface of the Sun (if there is such a thing).
How did they solve all problems of sending a man to the surface of the 
Sun??? Simple... their astronauts travelled during the night...
