The General Chairman is Paul Bialla, who is some official of General
Dynamics.

The emphasis seems to be on a scaled-down, fast plan to put *people*
on the Moon in an impoverished spaceflight-funding climate. You'd

modest money using an agressive series of robot spacecraft, but
there's not a hint of this in the brochure.
