And one of my profs is the chief engineer for the project (Dr. Ron
Humble, Univ. Colorado at Colorado Springs).

I love the idea of an inflatable 1-mile long sign.... It will be a
really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt  (or even better, a
Westford Needle!) comes crashing into it at 10 clicks a sec.  

<BOOM!>  Whooooooooshhhhhh......  <sputter, sputter>

<okay, PRETEND it would make a sound!>

I hear <insert favorite rumor here> that it will supposedly coincide
with the Atlanta Olympics.
