* The Keenan hiring is precipitated by the loss of an anticipated $5M
in playoff revenue and fears of losing season ticket-holders (!), plus
Paramount chief Stan Jaffe's chip against the Flyers over l'Affaire
Lindros last autumn.  Add to this that Neilsen might return as an
assistant coach [Gerald, what'd I say earlier today??], and Roger
conferred with Jaffe on the hiring.  This hiring by Jaffe went over
the head of MSG, Inc. (Par. subsidiary) head Bob Gutkowski and over
the head and the protests of Pres./GM Neil Smith.

* MSG is making the announcement on Saturday to get back at the
Islanders for making the playoffs (i.e., steal the press).

* Flyers owner Ed Snyder is livid and beside himself over this.

* Keenan will make up to $900,000/yr.

* Gary Bettman has appointed an independent consul to look at
Gil Stein's admission into the Hall of Fame.

* New crease colours, rather than blue?

* The Oilers will charge to eat in the Press Room next year.
