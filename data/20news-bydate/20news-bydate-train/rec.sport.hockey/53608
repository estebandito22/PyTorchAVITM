You know... after I finished laughing I thought:  This would be a great
final.  Two Canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that Don Cherry
nonsense behind them and a nail-biter finish.

Of course, I would prefer a Vancouver--Montreal final with Vancouver
scoring the final goal....

Pity neither will happen.
