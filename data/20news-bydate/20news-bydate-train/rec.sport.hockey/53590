: you mention could cut it as stars in the NHL! Even "Rexi" in his prime was more
: of a good regular in New York/Edmonton than a superstar in his own right,
: although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf.
:
I think that the NY management made a mistake, and remember how Edmonton 
called Reksa in the middle of the season to win the cup ? Why did they call
him?
 
: Yeah, we've had a tendency to beat ourselves in the past. I almost knifed my
: brother in anger when Sweden scored two in the final minute of the WC 
: semifinals back in 1986:-) Or what about the three goals Antero Kivela let in
: with five minutes to go against the Russkies in Lake Placid'80? Ugh . . . 

O.K., that was BAD luck. If Penguins have the same kind of luck this year in
the playoffs, they'll never win the cup. They are still the best team.
