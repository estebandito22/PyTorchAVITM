If we allow people like him to continue to do what he does, it's a
shame.  People say that cheap shots and drawing penalties by fake-
ing is part of the game, I say "Bullsh-t!".  If he ever tried some
like that on a Yzerman, he'd would have to deal with Probert now
wouldn't he?  What Ulf does isn't even retaliatory!  There's now
way one could justify what he does and if they do they're fools.
