Actually, the way I understand it, it is an octapus.
Apparently, a number of years ago, a fan threw an octapus on
the ice and the announcer said "Octapi will not occupy the ice"
or something like that, and it's happened ever since.  The fans
cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands, and
boo those who use a shovel.
