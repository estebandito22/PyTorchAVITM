Actually, Messier was invited, but declined due to nagging injuries...
Keenan and Messier have always gotten along...Keenan dumped Steve
Yzerman from the last Canada Cup team, even though Yzerman had
endured the training camp, when Messier who had missed essentially the
entire camp recovering from injuries became available at the
last moment.
