Ok guys, I need a list of the teams who have been hot or cold during the
last 25 games.  Doesn't need to be accurate, a rough guess will do.  I'm
about to enter a playoff pool and I want to know who is hot going into
the playoffs.  Don't need to mention Pittsburgh.  They can't get any hotter
than they are now.


P.S. I need this by Sunday
