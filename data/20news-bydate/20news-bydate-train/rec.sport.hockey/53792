NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Who's the mindscheme(?) behind this one -- Ted
Simmons?  As the saying goes, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  I'm 230
miles from home (during the school year) and will never be able to pick up
DVE.  At least now I can sort of make out what Mike and Steigy say through
all the static on KDKA.  This just may be enough reason for me to transfer
to Duquesne and live at home.  Who's going to announce on DVE anyway? 
Paulson and Krenn?  (Just kidding.)
