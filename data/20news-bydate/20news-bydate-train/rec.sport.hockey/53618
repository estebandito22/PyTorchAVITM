Well, thanks to everyone who has entered so far.  There are at least 40
entries, and hopefully more people will enter before the deadline, which
is 7:30 pm Today, Sunday, April 18, 1993!  In the interest of fairness,
since I will win anyway, I feel it is only right to actually tell everyone
my picks, so that you all won't cry "rigged" after I declare myself the
winner.  Here they are:

Pittsburgh-New Jersey		Pittsburgh		5
