  I thought that he was comparing Cullen to TEEMU SEL[NNE. I always thought
  that salami is some sort of sausage, BUT IF YOU, dear Roger, ARE ABLE TO
  SEE SALAMI ON THE ICE PLAYING HOCKEY... I don't know what to do, but you
  surely should do something and very quickly!!!

  Maybe you think that if you keep on talking some rubbish, after some time
  everybody will consider it to be really true... You should take care of
  your LEAFS, they surely need it more.

 During the latest Philly game the Leaf players didn't parade... Philly
 crunched them 4-0 !!!  Maybe you need some more two way players who can
 score, too !!???
