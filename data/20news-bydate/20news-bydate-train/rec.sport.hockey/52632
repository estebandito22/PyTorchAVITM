As I've mentioned in the rules posting, I will be out of town until the
day before the entry deadline, so I won't be able to respond to your

I would be grateful if someone could repost the rules and instructions for
the playoff pool sometime next week, for the benefit of those who missed the
first two postings.

Thanks.
