  Here we go again. Is this the same idiot who posted the Gretzky
trade to Toronto????   Sheeeesh!  You should have waited until we got
over that one before this garbage, maybe we would have believed it for

   By the way, I just heard from Mother Goose that Mario Lemieux was
traded to Winnpeg for Tie Domi!!!!!
