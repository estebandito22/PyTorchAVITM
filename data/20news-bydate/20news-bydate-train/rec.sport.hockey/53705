Well, actually now that you mention it, a few weeks ago the CBC ran a
documentary on "Ice Hockey in Harlem".  the Canadian Club of New York
(something like that) sponsors a league for kids in Harlem and based on
the TV report they all seemed to be having a lot of fun.  All playing
with regular equipment, jerseys, etc etc, on a proper outdoor rink.  It
looked just like kids playing hockey anywhere else.

Some of the kids were even fortunate to get a trip to a hockey camp in Alberta.
