Francis got 101 in 89-90, his last full season with Hartford.

In agreement with your previous post, I think Francis is a tremendous and
generally underrated complete player.  I would LOVE to have him here in a
Capitals uniform where he would certainly be the #1 center (even though
Pivonka is also a very good complete player who is generally underrated).
Francis impresses me in many ways as an "ethical Dale Hunter".  Tons of
heart and can-do attitude with a lot of different skills, but none of
the cheap shots and few penalty minutes.  Not to mention nearly always
coming through when it's important.
