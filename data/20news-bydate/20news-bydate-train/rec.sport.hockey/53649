In article 27089, alvstad@mari.acc-admin.stolaf.edu (Mad Dog) reports:

Are there any further stories to report on the eve' of Norm's farewell 
from the twin cities? In an earlier post, it was announced that Norm 
Green was given until midnight of the last home-game of the North Stars
to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena. 
Did this happen? Was Norm run-out-of-town?

Rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board, 
the score-board fell to the ice and flattened Mr. Greedy to a large
piece of green paper. Arena management had to use the Zamboni (which 
they confiscated from Norm's truck) to clean-up the useless remains.
