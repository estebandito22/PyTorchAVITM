Just curious, Roger, but since you have such a vast knowledge of the
game and the league, how come you haven't made a living out of it?
There must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field. I'm sure

a scout. Or maybe try a career as a reporter or tv commentator...
 
I might be wrong, of course, and you already have.
