Doesn't it also have the Statue of Liberty on it or is that Richter's Mask?

The back actually has a Bee followed by a Z to represent the Beezer. It 
also has something that looks like the three interconnecting circles from
the Led Zepplin 4 album cover. Is that what it is supposed to be? and if
it is does anybody know why he would put it there? Ali?
