Just heard on the news that Mike Keenan formerly of the Blackhawks, Flyers,
and General of a Siberian Prison has just signed to coach the Rangers.  The
Rangers, who won the President's Cup last year have slipped just a bit at the
end of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly Flyers.
The Flyers' fans are going to be disappointed on Keenans decision, because
they were very interested in him.  Oh well.

Go CAPS!!!!!!!
