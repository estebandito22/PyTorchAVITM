	There was apparently a 30 minute special here on the Penguins' 
season on ABC (WTAE - channel 4), immediately preceding the opening 
game against the Devils on Sunday.  I only turned it on in time to 
watch the credits.  If anyone taped it and is willing to let me borrow 
it to dub it, I would appreciate it.  I would be willing to come pick 
it up, and I'll return it the next day and buy you a beer.  Please 
respond via e-mail.  Thanks a lot.
	Oh yeah.  Was it any good?
