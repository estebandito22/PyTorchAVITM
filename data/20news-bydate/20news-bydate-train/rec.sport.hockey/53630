How was this trade bad? I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty
good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the
deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the 
Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they 
lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping
Esposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for
the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter).
