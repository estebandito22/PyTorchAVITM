Locked away, waiting for the tape-delay to start ...

It's nice that the Devils are starting out their playoffs on network
television ... too bad that their playoff game has been preempted on
WABC-AM for an early-season Yankees baseball game!

It's a 12-2 win by the Texas Rangers ... and they're delaying the
tape-delay by another half-hour for the ballgame "highlights"!!!
