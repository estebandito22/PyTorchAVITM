If anyone's still interested, I have ONE Mattel electronic game left for sale
or trade. It's Baseball (Tan Case) and includes a 9-volt battery and the
original manual!  I was able to sell Soccer and Basketball 2 for $70.00 and
traded the Football game for a Genesis cart...  so, I was happy.  I will
entertain all offers.. cash or Genesis carts...  By the way, Baseball is in
Excellent condition and works perfectly..
	
		Thanx in advance,
			Dave
