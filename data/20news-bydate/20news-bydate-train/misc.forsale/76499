     I am looking for a working docking deck (deck that goes on back of
camera) for an old JVC GX-S700 Tube video camera.  Any format is
acceptable.  Please send me a message if you even know anything about decks
for the GX-S700.  Also interested in any video equipment for sale,
professional or consumer.  Thank you.
