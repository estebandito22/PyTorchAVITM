Subject: 1.2 External FD for PS/2 (extremely cheap)

I have a brand new 1.2 external floppy drive for PS/2, still in the box.
I will sell it for $90 + shipping/firm, which is half of the market price
(check page 474 of Computer Shopper, Apr-93 issue, the price is $179 there).

Please let me know if you are interested.
