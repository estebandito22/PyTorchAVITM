	Two Round-Trip Tickets
	O'Hare --> Tuscon

	Good thru November
  No Reasonable Offer Refused, But lets start at
  $750 for both (Paid $925)

	Hopefully someone can use these as I
have no use for them, and don't know a  way 
to get my moneys worth without going to
Tuscon again!  `

	E-Mail only at this time
