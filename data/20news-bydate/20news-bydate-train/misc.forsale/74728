                            RESIDENTIAL LOT FOR SALE





               I have a nice residential lot available.  It is approx-
          imately 1/2 acre in size.  It is located in the development
          called Belvedere Plantation in Pender County, eastern North
          Carolina, north of Wilmington.  The lot is near the Intra-
          Coastal Waterway.  Golf and tennis are located on the
          development property.  Belvedere Plantation also has a mar-
          ina facility on the ICW.  This lot is nearby to all of the
          facilities mentioned.



               I own the lot outright but it does not look like I will
          get back to the area anytime soon.  I would like to sell it
          for that reason.  Make an offer.



               If interested please send E-mail.
