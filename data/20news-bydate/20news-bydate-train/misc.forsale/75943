I need some used scanners.  I'm limiting my selection to HP models
with document feeders.  I think this means the ScanJet Plus and the
ScanJet IIc.

so...if you have one of these and want to sell it, please tell me.

P.S.  I need only one with a Mac interface; the others are for IBM-PC
compatibles.
