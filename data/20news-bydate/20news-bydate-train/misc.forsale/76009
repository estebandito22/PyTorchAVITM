Dear Fellow Usenet Users:

	I would like to give a formal apology for posting an advertisement 
about my printing business.  I did not intend this to be an advertisement, 
but rather an offer for people on the usenet, many of whom use printing
on a regular basis.  I was not aware that this is not "legal" on the usenet.
I am only trying to put myself through college.  For those of you who
requested information, I will write to you privately.  For those of you who 
are having fun flooding my mailbox, I think you can grow up.  To offer advice
is one thing, but to use profanity toward me is another.

Thank you,  

Marc    ME9574@albnyvms.bitnet
