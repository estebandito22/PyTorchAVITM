Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman,
the TCD-D7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3.  Also, the D7
has a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks.  Oh, the D3 has always been
available through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... with
the new model coming out, I suspect the now obsolete D3 will be selling for 
even less.
