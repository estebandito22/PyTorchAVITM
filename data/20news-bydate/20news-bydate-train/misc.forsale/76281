Looking for a VIDEO in and OUT Video card for the IBM.  One that will
allow you to watch TV (coax) or video IN, and will do Video out,
digitize pictures.  and if I am in Windows, and would like to be able to
look the RCA out for the card to my TV and have it display on there, as
well as DOS apps.

I heard of these SNES and Genesis copiers, that will copy any games, are
those for real?
