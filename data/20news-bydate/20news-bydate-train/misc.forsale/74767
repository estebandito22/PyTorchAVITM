According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any
utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS6 may be worth it. 

For people who have DOS5, and some sort of utility, DOS6 doesn't offer
much. You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create, however. :-)
