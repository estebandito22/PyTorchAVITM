The only option you "should" jumper is the drive select, shown as "4C32C1"
above.  There is also a drive power-up option jumper (elsewhere on the
drive's board) but the odds of that having been unset are slim.

Since the 3B1 "normally" has only one HD, you would jumper betwwwn "C1" to
select the first (possible) drive address; if the 2190 is your second drive
on the 3B1, then jumper between "2C".
