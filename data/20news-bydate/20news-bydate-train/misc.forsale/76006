        Smith Corona Typewriter for sale,

        Model SCM 70 electric.

Great for forms, envelopes, labels, small things, etc. that you just
can't do with your microcomputer.

Built like a tank, but not big nor that heavy.  A classic compact
electric, with padded storage bag.  No scratches, enamel paint chips
or dents.  Cloth ribbon, 2 colours.  Will accept best offer near $70.

(Selling for a friend, so these are her instructions not mine.
RSVP to this account, though.  Make any other offers anyways,
I'll pass them along.  A single sheet-feeder for the Macintosh
Imagewriter II would be acceptable in trade, for example.)
