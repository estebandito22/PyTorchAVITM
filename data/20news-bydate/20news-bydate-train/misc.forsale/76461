I have a UREI 527A 27-band (mono) Equilizer for sale.  Anyone who knows
this unit knows it's been a recording studio standard for years.  It's a
pretty straightforward unit, with balanced ins and outs.  Power supply caps
were recently replaced, and I added XLR connectors (which can be easily
removed if you prefer, as I mounted them on a bracket outside the case). 
The unit is in good shape, and is sonically very clean.

I'm asking $225 + UPS shipping.  They're going for $250 generally.  Make me
an offer.
