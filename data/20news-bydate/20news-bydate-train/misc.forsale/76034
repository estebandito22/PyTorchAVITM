someone gave me this brand new card.  I am thinking to sell it cuz
I don't need it.  but the problem is that i don't even know what this
is.
this was made by Forte Communications Co. it has 2 board combined
together (looks wierd  to me) and has 2 9 pin ports (one male and one
female), and also has a round port (like BNC, not sure).
this was made in 1986, and has a "fortegraph emulator & diagnostic" disk
with it.

has anyone here ever seen this or known what this is.

appreciate your help in advance.
