	1987 ARIENS RIDING LAWN MOWER

	This mower is in perfect condition and
	contains the following features:

	- Electric Start
	- 26 inch cut
	- Double Rear Baggers
	- New Battery
	- New Engine (one year old)
	- Inflatable Tires (gives nice ride)
	- Cushioned Seat (gives nice ride)
	- Tuned up and blade sharpened in the
	  past month

	I am moving into a house that has a
	small area of grass to cut and does not
	require such large mower. The engine was
	replaced, not rebuilt, last year due to
	some faulty work done by a lawn mower
	repair shop.

	PRICE:  $600.00
	PHONE: 908-582-7028 (Day)
	       609-259-0763 (Nights & Weekends)
