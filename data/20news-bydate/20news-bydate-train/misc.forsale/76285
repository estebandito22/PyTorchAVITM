Northwest Air tix - SAVE $30 ANY FLIGHT

I have a $400 credit with Northwest Airlines which must be used
by Nov 27, 1993. 

There is a $50 charge to change the ticket, so I will sell it for
$320.  It can be used for any Northwest flight, but I don't think
they will refund cash.

Please contact me at tallen@corp.hp.com  or (415)857-5878.
