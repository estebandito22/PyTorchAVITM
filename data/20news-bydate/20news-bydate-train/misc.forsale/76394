For Sale...:
 
        **BRAND NEW** Hewlett Packard toner cartridge
        model number HP 92295A.
 
 
        o I am selling this toner because I recently
          bought a Brother HL-10V printer and the
          toner that I am selling.  I activated the
          toner, but ended up returning the printer.
          The store, however would not take back the
          toner.  This toner has been used to print
          only three pages and is in perfect condition.
          I will protect it for shipment so that no
          toner escapes.  It comes with all original
          packaging and manuals.  The toner is compatible
          with ANY laser printer that uses the model
          number of the toner I am selling; just look in
          your manual to see if it will work for you.
          I will not go below $60.00.  I will pay the
          shipping to anywhere in the continental 
          United States.
 
        If you are interested, leave me email or call Kirk
Peterson at (303) 494-7951 anytime.
 
        Thank you!
