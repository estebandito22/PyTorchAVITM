This is yet for a friend again.

EMS Freq. Shifter. (The machine that made those 3-D swirling guitar effects
                    way back in the 70's.)

is the last unit EMS ever made. Rack mountable. Mono in, Up/Down signals out
with seperate Pan out and sine/unsine voltage outs. VCO input too to control
