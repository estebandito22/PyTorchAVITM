	Well, Dale, I'd say offhand "Keel-hauling" would work pretty
well...we haven't had a good "keel-hauling" in a long time... (Sorry, it came up in a conversation yesterday and, well, I just love that phrase...)
	Or maybe just ask for folks to flood the guys mailbox with
the FAQ for net-etiquitte...sort of poetic justice for all the junk mail
he was trying to generate anyway...
