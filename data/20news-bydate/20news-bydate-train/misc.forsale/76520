Hello again folks!
 
Been a while since I last sold thangs, but the last time went with no problems,
and I'm moving again, so I have a few keyboard stands that I don't need
anymore and don't want to drag back across the country.

Ultimate Support Stand:
 
**Probably SOLD, will see if it is gone by Saturday (pick-up date).
 
---
Rok-Steady 3-tier keyboard stand:
$95 or best offer (try me)
one x-shaped bottom unit, with two sets of "arms" that attach
to that to support keyboard (2) above the main "X".

Shipping not included in the above prices, but details can be worked out
if you're interested in these items.
