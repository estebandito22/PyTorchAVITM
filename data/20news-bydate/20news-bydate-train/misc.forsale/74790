          I  am  cleaning  out  the coffers.  I have a virtually 
          MINT collection of HEAVY METAL magazine.  This is  NOT 
          a  music  mag  but the really neato mag with Giger and 
          Moebius  artwork,  et  al.  Jam  packed  with  amazing 
          sci-fi  and  fantasy artwork by many masters.  All are 
          mint with the exception of the 3 that have split  seam 
          on  the  cover  only but are otherwise perfect, no cut 
          outs or missing pages.  I have Sep, Nov and Dec issues 
          for 1978, ALL issues for 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982,  1983 
          and  Jan  thru  Sep  for  1984  (72  issues  in  all i 
          believe).  I will not break  them  up.  They  will  be 
          sold  as  a  single  lot.  Send  your  offers  to  me. 
          Shipping not included,  these  are  pretty  heavy.  Of 
          course  if  you are local (Mass, USA) you can come get 
          'em in person.
