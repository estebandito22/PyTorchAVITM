I was wrong! I guess they are closer to $800 new! I will
probably still sell them for the above implied $300 obo.
Email me if you want more specifics. This is a really 
attractive set of books, kind of a Bible encyclopedia set.
Also email me if you know more about these books or post
the information here.
