They're the latest versions. I've priced these programs
at less than half the list price and significantly less
than the cheapest mail-order price around.
 
* OS/2 2.0, can run Windows, DOS, and OS/2 programs,
superior stability compared to Windows, list $169, sale
$60.
 
* NORTON COMMANDER FOR OS/2, provides better file
management than OS/2 does alone, graphical tree and file
list, drag and drop, launch apps from customizable menu,
list $149, sale $60.
 
If you're interested in any of these programs, please phone me at
215-885-7446 (Philadelphia) and I'll save the package for you.
