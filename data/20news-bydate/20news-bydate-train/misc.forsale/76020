Hi,

	I have a Quantum ProDrive LPS 40 MB SCSI hard drive for sale.
	It came with my MacIIsi and was replaced by a larger hard drive.
	In great working condition. Fast and quiet. Never had a problem.

	Asking $100+COD shipping or reasonable offer.

	Also for sale with the drive:

	Brand new mounting bracket for MacII or MacSE. It also includes
	SCSI data and power cable. $10 with the HD.

	Please reply with email or call (217)337-5710 and leave message.

	Thanks.
