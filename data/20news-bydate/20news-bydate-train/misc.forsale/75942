Hi!

I have several computer related books for sale. They are all new,
unused and hence in excellent condition. The subjects include
Programming Languages (C, C++, LISP, PROLOG), Operating Systems
(UNIX, DOS), Windows, X-Windows, LAN, AI, and Expert Systems.

If you are interested, pls. contact me at:

Thanks.
