Looking to save money?  I am your man.  I will mail you 
$5 in food coupons for only$2.50.  Or you will get twice the dollar amount
of coupons.  So mail $15 and get $30 dollars in coupons. Sounds like a great
deal well it is.  Send SASE to 766 S.Elizabeth St. Salt Lake City, Utah 84102
enclose money in form of a money order.  Personally, I would not trust a person
to send coupons after money is sent.  Well, let me earn your trust.  Send
$1 dollar, and I'll send you your $2 in store coupons.  
Then we'll talk more
e-mail enquiries to yb025@uafhp.uark.edu

Thank you,
John Schiefer
