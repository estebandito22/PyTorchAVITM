	I will be in Boston (Cambridge specifically) working this summer
and am in need of a place to stay. If you have a room to sublease, or
anything of the sort I would appreciate a mail.
I am a 20-year old white male and am very flexible. I can adapt to a smoking
or non-smoking environment. Access to the 'T' would be nice, though I will 
have a car thus need a parking space. 
I would need this from late May or early June until aproximately end of July.
Any responses welcome.
