My girlfriend switched to gas-permeable hard lenses and no longer
needs a one year old soft contact lens cleaning unit.  It's one of
those where you pop in the lens case filled with solution and the
lenses, press the lighted timer button and let it cook.  No stains
(of course -- if you've owned one of these, you understand), maybe
a little dust on the cover.

Best cash offer, or equivalent worth in used CD's or Betamax tapes
(some blanks or a couple of pre-recorded movies/concerts).
