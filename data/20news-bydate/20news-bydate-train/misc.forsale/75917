Subject: !!!!JAZZ CD 4 sale/trade!
Lines: 7

I have an unopened CD called "Bird-The Original Recordings of Charlie
Parker"  It has on it, among others: Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie,
Red Rodney, Thelonious Monk, and Lester Young.
I would be willing to sell it to the highest bidder, or else to trade
it for another jazz CD that I would be interested in.
