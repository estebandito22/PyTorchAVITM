Hi, looking for any advice or suggestions about a problem I'm
having with MIT X11R5's editres, in particular under twm variants.

For a start, 9 times out of 10 (but NOT always) editres won't
grab a widget tree when running on our NCD (Decwindows) Xterms,
which I'm told will be fixed when the R5 (not R4) XDm is installed.
OK, so I tried running it on a Sun, running real R5, on the same
network - I get a widget tree, but it's ALWAYS for 'TWM Icon Manager'

Anybody know of any patches for (a) twm or (b) editres that I should
look at?

Thanks,
K
