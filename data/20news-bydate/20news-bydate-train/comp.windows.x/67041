Help: I am running some sample problems from O'Reilly volume 4,
Xt Intrisics Programming Manual, chapter 3. popup
dialog boxes and so on.

In example 3.5, page 76 : "Creating a pop-up dialog box"

The application creates window with a button "Quit" and "Press me".
The button "Press me" pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of
this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the
first time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th .... time), 
it is *much* slower.

Has anyone any experience with these sample programs, or why I get
this behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response
time from 2nd time onwards ?
Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time
they popup in reasonable fast response time ?

Thankyou - Shirley
