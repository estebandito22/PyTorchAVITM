Hi,
    I have a piece of X code that compiles fine on pmax-ul4, pmax_mach, as
well as sun4_mach, but whenever it compiles on sun4_411, it gives me 
undefined ld errors:
_sin
_cos
_pow
_floor
_get_wmShellWidgetClass
_get_applicationShellWidgetClass

The following libraries that I linked it to are:
-lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11

The makefile is generated off an imake template.
Can anyone give me pointers as to what I'm missing out to compile on
a sun4_411?

Thanx
Wilson
