Subject: What determines the default X font?
Organization: Lund Institute of Technology, Sweden

I'm running X under openwindows 3.  Normal X programs not having a
font specified always show up in the same font - until I change the
fontpath, and restart windows - then a new default font is used until
the next change.  I can't seem to figure out how it chooses.  Is there
some way to set this?  Possibly something in .Xdefaults???

Please reply in direct email - I summarize.
