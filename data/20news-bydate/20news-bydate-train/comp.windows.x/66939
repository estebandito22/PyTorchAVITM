Is it possible to run an MIT R5 based Xserver on a Sun with a Rasterops TC
Colorboard (24bit board)?  I have the Xsun24 patches for supporting sun's
24bit frame buffers but does the rasterops appear as if its a cgtwelve or
something else?  I know nothing about the rasterops other than we might be
buying one to put in an IPX.

cheers
