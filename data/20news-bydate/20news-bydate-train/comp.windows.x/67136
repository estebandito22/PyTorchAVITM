Hi.  I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to
find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as
CapsLock and NumLock.  I can certainly track the events inside of my
window and set a boolean there, but what if CapsLock is pressed in
another window?  I looked at XGrabKey() and decided it was definitely
NOT what I wanted to do.  I could find no convenience function to tell
me that information.

My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state
of CapsLock and/or NumLock is?

An even more pointed question: Is there an easy means of making an X
keyboard act like a PC keyboard?  ie, CapsLock is active, and the user
presses shift-a, I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'.

Any input is greatly appreciated. Please respond via email.  I will
repost a summary of my findings.

			Thanks, Ralph
