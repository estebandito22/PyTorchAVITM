We have recently obtained a copy of color_xterm (from export.lcs.mit.edu) after
seeing it mentioned in a previous article. On compilation, it reports the
following undefined symbols:
	_get_wmShellWidgetClass
	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass

	but still runs. When sending escape sequences to set the colour,
any colour comes out as black text on a black background. Any Ideas?

Has anyone used this program in colour successfully?

Can anyone point me to any other colour terminal emulators?

We are running OpenWindows 3 on Sun Sparcs running SunOS 4.1.3.
