Dear netters,

I have noticed something rather weared (I think) about creating a dialog shell
widget while running HP Vue's vuewm.

For some reason, every time I create a dialog shell the foreground and backgroun
d colors are different compared to my toplevel shell.
I am not doing anything special/different.

Does any body know anything about this problem?? How to fix it without hardcodin
g the colors ?

Please respond to kamlesh@salzo.cary.nc.usa ....

Thanks !
-Kamlesh
