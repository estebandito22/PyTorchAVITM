Hi netland,

I thought that I once read about the existance of a virtual mwm like vtwm.
On the usual ftp sites (gatakeeper.dec.com, export.lcs.mit.edu) I can't find
any trace of this program. Could anybody give me a hint where to find this
program or confirm/deny the existance of this program.

Regards,

  Stefan
