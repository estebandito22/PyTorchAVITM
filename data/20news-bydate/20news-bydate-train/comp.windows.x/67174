 I have a problem when I'm using PostScript. When I am working local
on a SUN SPARCstaton IPC the PostScript works good, but when I connect
to the SUN from a X-terminal I just get error messages that the
PostScript cannot connect to the news-display.

 Why doesn't PostScript work on an X-terminal?

 Is there any way to make it work?
