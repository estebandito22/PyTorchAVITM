I have a toggleButton widget (yes widget) and I have a routine
which changes the color of the foreground and background of the
label.  Well, the background changes alright, but the label
text does not redraw itself.

I am guessing that I have to force it to redraw with an
XExposeEvent sent to it via XSendEvent.  Is this the best
way to get the text up again?  I can't seeem to get
XSEndEvent to work right.... if this is a good approach,
might anyone have an example lying around to show me how to
do this?  I've RTFM all evening and did not find a decent
example.

PS I keep getting Segmentation Faults in XSEndEvent, tho all
the values are as expected.

Thanks in Advance
