1) This is NOT a feature of the Window Manager but of xterm.
2) This sequences are NOT ANSI compatible, are they ?
   Does anyone know IF there are compatible sequences for this and what they
   are ? I would think they are DCS (device control sequence) introduced,
   but may be a CSI sequence exists, too ?
   This MUST work on a dxterm (VT and ANSI compatible), it may not work
   on xterms.
