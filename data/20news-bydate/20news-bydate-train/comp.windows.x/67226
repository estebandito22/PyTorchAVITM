You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each
modifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier
you want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only
way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are 
used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock
modifier).

I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous
assignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then
one modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any.

X doesn't handle locking modifiers that well. 

Hope that helps,
