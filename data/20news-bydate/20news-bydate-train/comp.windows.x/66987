Hi Folks.

As part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple
icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your
own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can
just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately
you can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with
icons which your application doesn't specifically own.

In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in 
my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the
icon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes
any difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE.

Thanks -
Scott :)
