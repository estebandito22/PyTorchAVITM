 I have just finished building X11R5 on a 386 running Interactive Unix (SysVR3)
and I am having a problem with xterm.  On any font larger that 5x7 it messes up
characters that are types, the cursor seems to be "too" large, or splits into
a 1/2 reverse video, 1/2 outline block (which changes when the pointer is moved
into the window).  I am trying to use monospaced fonts (not -p- fonts).  Is
there any way of changing the appearence of the block cursor is an Xterm?

 Thanks
