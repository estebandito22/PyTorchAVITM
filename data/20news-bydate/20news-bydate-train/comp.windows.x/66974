Hi

I am trying to implement a pointer feature in Xlib

I have multiple windows and all can take input and 
show output simultaneously on all other displays

I want to implement a pointer feature 

I would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once 
I choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able
to see it

Can you give me some hints as to how I should proceed 


replies will be greatly appreciated

Thank you
Prakash
