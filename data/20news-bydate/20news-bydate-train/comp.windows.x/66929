I am looking for a package that implements standard
image processing functions (reading/writing from
standard formats), clipping, zoom, etc. implemented
under X. Both public domain and private packages
are of interest. The particular application area I
have in mind is medical imaging, but a package meant
for a more general context would be acceptable.

Please reply to me; I will summarize on the net if
there is general interest.
