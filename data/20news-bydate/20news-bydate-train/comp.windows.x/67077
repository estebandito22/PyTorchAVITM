How can I get the font family, weight and slant from an
instance of a widget? Using initFontContext(), getNextFont()
and freeFontContext() I can get the size of the font (and a
bunch of other stuff concerning the font) but nowhere have
I found family, weight and slant. Assume that I do not have
access to the source where family, weight and slant were
orginaly used when creating a fontlist.
Thanks a bunch and have a great day,
Carl
