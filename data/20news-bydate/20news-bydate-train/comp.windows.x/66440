I suspect this is because VUE creates a window (probably OverrideRedirect)
that is the size of (or larger than) the Root Window. Because the window
manager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the
mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested
but you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root
window. 

Contact HP support and see whether VUE can support coloured bitmap format
such as xpm, if they cant then they probably create all their coloured
backdrops inside the code.
