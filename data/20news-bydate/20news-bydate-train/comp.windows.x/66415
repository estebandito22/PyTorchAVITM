I need to have PCs and SPARCstations run the same application ( namely
MicroSoft Project ). The original system ran on the PC. Now it needs to
be expanded to allow UNIX users to work with the application. The
current proposal is to use DESQview/X as a display server for the
application.

I would like to know your experiences with using DESQview/X to run an
application on a PC and displaying on a SPARCstation. I've heard that
the network traffic is slow.

Replies only by e-mail please.

Thanks, in advance.
