Hi,
     I just got myself a Gateway 4DX-33V and trying to configure
X11R5 for it.  Has anyone done this before ?  More specifically,
I need a correct Xconfig file entry that is set up for my 
graphics card and monitor.  I have a 15" Color CrystalScan 1572FS monitor
and a VESA LOCAL BUS ATI Ultra Pro with 1MB VRAM video card.

Any help will be extremely appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
