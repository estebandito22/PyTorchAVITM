I just had an idea. I'm not sure if its been done and I'm just
remembering it unconsiously, but I thought that in dialog
boxes and whatever in windowing systems, there should be a
way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or
filled in a certain way. My idea: tape. You know, like putting
a piece of tape over a light switch?
Just an idea, if you like it, use it.
