Greetings.

I am developing an application that allows a *user* to interactively
create/edit/view a visual "model" (i.e. topology) of their network, and
I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to
simplify this task.

In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIM/X product to develop other
GUIs, so I am familiar with UIMSs in general.

The topology will support objects and connecting links.  Once the
topology is created, I want to provide the user with capabilities to
support grouping, zooming, etc.

I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing
routines to accomplish this.  Specifically, the zooming and grouping
aspects may prove difficult, and certainly time consuming,  if I have
to "roll my own".

Suggestions?
