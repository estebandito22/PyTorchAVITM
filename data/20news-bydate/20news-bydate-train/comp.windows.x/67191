Subject: Q: Colormaps with dialog shells
Organization: MIT Media Laboratory
Lines: 17


I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with
XCreateColormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit
display.  When I move the cursor over the window I get the "Technicolor
Effect" - which is fine.  Basically, my program works.

My problem/question is: When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for
some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to
XmDIALOG_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL.  The result is that if my cursor is
over the dialogShell I get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the
applicationShell (or any window other than the dialogShell) I get the
default colormap.  But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_
window of my application, I get my colormap.

Any suggestions?  Thanks,

david,
