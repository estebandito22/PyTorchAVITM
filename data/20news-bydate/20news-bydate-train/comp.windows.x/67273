Subject: Bitplaned ("non-chunky" pixel) cfb????
Organization: Department of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh
Lines: 17

Is there a PD version of cfb, or other PD server stuff, which has a colour frame
buffer implementation which works in bitplaned mode, i.e. where the screen
memory is grouped so that "bit 0 of every pixel is here, bit 1 is there, etc."

The only such beast I know if at the moment is the GfxBase server for the
Commodore Amiga, and it is commercial. I don't know if they wrote their own cfb,
but I suspect they did.

Please respond by email, as I don't read this group.

Many thanks
Dave
