Hi, 

has anybody implements an RPC server in the HP Xwindows? In SUN Xview, there
is a notify_enable_rpc_svc() call that automatically executes the rpc processes
when it detects an incoming request. I wonder if there is a similar function in
HP X/motif that perform the same function.

any help is appreciated.
