Hi,

I am about to write an application in X/Motif that will require the
embedding of a pseudo tty. So, before I re-invent the wheel, has anyone
written/gotten a motif widget that does the job ? Otherwise, I would
appreciate any pointers to make such a beast.

My environment is X11R4/Motif 1.1 and X11R5/Motif 1.2 (if this helps).


Thanks in advance.
