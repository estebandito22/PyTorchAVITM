Hi All!

I tried to run SoftPC, a PC emulation software program, installed on a Silicon 
Graphics workstation from a Human Design System (HDS) X terminal, and 
everything went fine, except the fonts could NOT be converted from one type 
of format to the other - HDS uses different font format from SGI worksation.
So, I have the following questions:

1. How do you resolve different font formats from different machines?

2. Is there a program to convert one type of font format to another?

If you have similar problems/experiences and have found a solution, please 
let me know.  Your help will be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance for your help and information.
