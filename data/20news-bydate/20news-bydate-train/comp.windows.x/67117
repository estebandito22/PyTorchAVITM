Does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing
of X/Motif applications. I am thinking of a system which I could
program (or which could record events/output) with our verification
test procedures and then run/rerun each time we do regression
testing. I am interested in a product like this for our UNIX
projects and for a separate project which will be using OpenVMS.
