HI,
  I am looking for an X app that will display dxf files. These are
  ascii text files that are normally associated with autocad. I have
  a large 9 meg. file of the state of wisconsin that i would like to
  views and or cut into smaller chunks.

  I also would like to find a complete file layout for dxf files.

  Any information would be appreciated.
