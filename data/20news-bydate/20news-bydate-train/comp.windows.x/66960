I have the exact same problem when running Hewlett Packard's Microwave Design
System (MDS) from an HP 380 unix box and running MacX 1.2, Sys 7.0.1*.
Normally, MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround, but occasionally
it becomes a light blue and all the text, etc, inside the window become
"washed out" (nearly invisible). I thought that it was just something
brain dead that I was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or INIT.

By slightly moving the window, and forcing a re-draw, the colors get corrected.
