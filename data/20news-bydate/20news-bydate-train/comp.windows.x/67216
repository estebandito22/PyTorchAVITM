Subject: Installation problem with X11R5
Organization: Rice University
Lines: 32

I am in the process of installing X11R5 on my Sun Sparcstation 2 and
have run into a problem.  I imagine it has something to do with a missing
screen driver, or something along those lines, but figured someone out there
in Internet land might be able to help.

I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed, and would
like to have both installed concurrently.  Thus, I set it up to compile to my
/usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with
gcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI,
so I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it, however, I get a message
along the lines of:

Getting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socket

sunOpenFrameBuffer : Inappropriate ioctl for device

Fatal server error : no screens found 


Any ideas on how I can fix it?  Please respond by e-mail at the below
address.

Thanks in advance.
