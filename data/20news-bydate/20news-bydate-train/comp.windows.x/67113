The multi-lingual archives at The Computing Research Labs, New Mexico
State University will be moving to a new ftp address soon.  The
archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical
Research.

The new ftp address will be: clr.nmsu.edu (the current IP address
is 128.123.1.12 but may change, so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever
possible).

Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and
clr.nmsu.edu.  The crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items
not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research.

The Arabic, Chinese, French, Italian, Indian, Japanese, Korean,
Tibetan, and Vietnamese archives will all be moved.

We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once
the archives have been moved.

Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to
either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu.  It will take a few days to move
everything.

If you are not familiar with our multi-lingual archives, we have been
slowly collecting various software, fonts, and text for different
languages over the past 2 years.  Most of the software is currently
Unix oriented.  We would also like to encourage people to continue to
contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and
quantity of multi-lingual tools.

If you have an item to contribute, please put it in:

clr.nmsu.edu:incoming/

and send a note to lexical@nmsu.edu telling them about your
contribution.

If you have any questions or comments, please send them to:
lexical@nmsu.edu
