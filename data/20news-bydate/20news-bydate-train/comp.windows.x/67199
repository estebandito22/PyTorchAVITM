I am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics
and imagery.  The user of the widget will be able to specify,
when creating it, whether it is to operate in X or GL mode.

I have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button
presses.  They work fine when the widget is in X mode.  In GL 
mode they only work when the widget (my GL/X widget) is a child
of a manager.  Put another way, the translations do not work 
when the widget is configured in GL mode and is a child of a 
shell.  Does anyone know why this is happening?

Thanks in advance.
