Subject: How to disable reverse video on xterm/man

Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask, but let me try anyway.
I am running xterm and like all UNIX users, I run man <something>. Recently,
I switched to Solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with ".I" directives
that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm.
The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at.
Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2, I remember their man pages have some keywords
displayed with underlining....

So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under ".I" directives 
for nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. (".B" 
directives are fine, I like them. And of course, I don't want to go in and edit
the man pages inputs...) Somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font
and a bold font, but not an italic font??

Any pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Thanks -- John

P.S. Running xterm -rv won't work, I tried...
