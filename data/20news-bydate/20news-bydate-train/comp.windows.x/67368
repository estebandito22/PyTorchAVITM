	Imake support for xmosaic
	=========================

Although xmosaic is a great program in general, it unfortunately comes
without Imake support. So I created one. Until Marc Andreessen finds the
time to incorporate it in an official xmosaic release, you can easily do it
yourself. Use anonymous FTP to get

	ftp.germany.eu.net:/pub/X11/misc/xmosaic.Imake.tar.z

The file's size is 3200 Byte. You will need gzip to unpack it. Have fun!
