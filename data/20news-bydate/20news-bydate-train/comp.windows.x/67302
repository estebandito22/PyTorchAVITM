Hello,

I am looking for someone to help me with the proceedure for remote login, via
modem not ethernet, to our new silicon graphics iris machines.  I can log in to
them only as a vt100 terminal regardless of what I am emulating on my end.  I
have communication software, kermit, which supports tek 401x and vt102
emulation.  The x windows manual lists XTERM as the appropriate command to
change the terminal type.  When I try it the reponse is 'unable to open window'

Thanx in advance

Keith Grider
