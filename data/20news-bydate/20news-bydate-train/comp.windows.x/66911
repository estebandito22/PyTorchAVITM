Hi *,

Has anyone out there compile a list of X security holes??  If
yes, will you please send me a copy of this??  If this is a
wrong group, please point me to a right one.  Thanks!!

BTW, the list doesn't have to contain the info "How to use
the holes?".  Instead, I need the info of how to detect
the holes, how to seal the holes, and how to monitor the 
activities if possible.

Any info is welcomed.  Thanks!!
