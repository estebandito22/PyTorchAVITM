Subject: X bitmap -> Postscript
Lines: 10

Hey folks,

on the course to develope a X window application, we encountered
a problem. How could I transform a X window bitmap into a postscript
files ? Is there any library routines or source code I can call to
do the job ?

Thank you in advance.
p.s. Email reply please. I seldom read this newsgroup. =)
