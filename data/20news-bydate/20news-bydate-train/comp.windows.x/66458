Hi,
	I am in the process of making the decision whether I should
write c++ wrappers for motif myself or use Motif++ or Interviews.
Though I have downloaded the tar files, I fail to see any
documentation. I have two questions:
	1) If you have used these or similar c++sy toolkits what has been
your experience?
	2) Where do I find reference books /documentation for them?

any and all input will be greatly appreciated.
