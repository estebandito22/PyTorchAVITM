We have recently purchased a Tektronix xterminal, and I'm having
a problem with it. We have a graphics widget that we wrote to
display waveforms, and it doesn't work on the xterminal. the buttons,
etc, all show up, and it seems to take the 'right' amount of time to
draw, but nothing is visible in the graphics window. I
have no clue as to where to start looking: the program works fine
on all our suns (3s and 4s, color and B&W). could anyone suggest a
line of attack for this problem?

TekXpress XP380 color xterminal running 6.0.0. host is a Sun IPX
running SunOS 4.1.3 and X11R5, PL17.
