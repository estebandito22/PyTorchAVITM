I need to port several OS/2 PM applications to X (OpenWindows or Motif),
and desperately need any information on how to go about doing this (short
of a complete rewrite.
 
Are there any tool to make porting easer?
Any References?
Any talent out there to hire to do this?
I will even take an OS/2 Presentation Mgr emulator for sun!
 
Any, and all replies (except flames) welcome!
