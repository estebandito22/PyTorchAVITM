I am trying to run xwd on a Sun SPARCstation IPX
with SunOS 4.1.2 and Openwindows 3.0. I am using
the Motif window manager. I have been unsuccessful
in using xwd under Motif. I get the following when
doing xwd -out xwd.dmp

X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  73 (X_GetImage)
  Resource id in failed request:  0x500043
  Serial number of failed request:  213
  Current serial number in output stream:  213

Does anyone have any insight to this ?
