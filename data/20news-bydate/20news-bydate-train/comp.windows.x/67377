Dear sun and windows people,

I am running sun workstations with SunOs 4.1.1 and 
vanilla X11 R5. I have a bunch of xterminals as well.

Today I had my xdm fail. At about 9:30
it was impossible to login to a host from an xterminal.
The message was the "xdm too many retransmissions".
In my xdm-errors file I had the following entries:


  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
  >256
  >error (pid 7927): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be
  >secured
  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
  >
  >I also had:

  >error (pid 7457): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be
  >secured
  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
  >256
  >error (pid 7462): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be
  >secured
  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
  >256

Also, at the console, the login box would come up for
about 2 seconds and then
it would go away. It would do this continuously.

I could login from another workstation to the hosts in question,
however, I could not login on the console.

I tried killing xdm and restarting it but that didn't help.
I finally rebooted all the hosts. (Which hurts when done in the
middle of the day).

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Phil
