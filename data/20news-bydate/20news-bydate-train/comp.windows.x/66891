Hi Xperts, some simple questions for you:

I've seen a lot of different terms, which seem to mean the same thing.
Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean:

	-) multi-screen
	-) multi-headed
	-) multi-display
	-) X-Server zaphod mode

Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle
(in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ?

How is the capability called, if I want to move the cursor from one
screen/display to another.

Any hints welcome.

Thanks, rainer.
