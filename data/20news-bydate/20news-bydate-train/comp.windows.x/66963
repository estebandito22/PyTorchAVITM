Subject: Is TEK quitting Xterm activities ???
Organization: Ahold NV, Zaandam, Netherlands, EEC
Lines: 13

I caught up a mailmessage from an NCD guy, who stated that Tek
might be quitting it's X terminal activities and would be looking
for an interested buyer.
Since the source of this message is NCD, THIS MIGHT ONLY BE NASTY
GOSSIP !!!
Can anyone say more about this??

Dick.
