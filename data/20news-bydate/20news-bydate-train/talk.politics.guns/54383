What an incrediblt sexist remark! Come now, Mike, what ever possessed you to
make such a un-PC remark?  I hope all women out there reading this are as
incensed as I am. Remember, WOMAN ARE JUST AS GOOD AS MEN!!!! 

Women stand up for your right to be just as stupid as men. In fact, insist on
every oppurtunity to be even more stupid than men! You've got the right, use
it!

Hey, it's a slow afternoon and I really don't want to get back to that
report...;)

BTW: mega-smileys for the humor impaired...
