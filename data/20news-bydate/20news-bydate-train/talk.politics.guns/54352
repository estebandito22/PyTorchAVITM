Hmm... am I the only person that remembers Masada?  This isn't the first time
a group has committed suicide to avoid persecution/capture... and you seem to
miss the point that the raid SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!
I find the FBI actions too damn reminiscent of the Warsaw Ghetto... fitting 
that Al Gore was in Poland for events marking the 50th anniversery of that...
Remove any references to dates and you have two raids by government troops
wearing black uniforms, carrying automatic weapons, backed by armored vehicles,
against religious minorities they claim were practicing sexually deviant 
behavior and hoarding weapons... Too damn similar...

James

ps: I am not advocating the BD's, I just find the whole situation too damn 
troubling.
