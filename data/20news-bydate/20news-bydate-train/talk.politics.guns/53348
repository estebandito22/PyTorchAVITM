good job to whoever posted the article.  I'd
been saving that NYTimes edition for a while, planning to ytpe it
in myself, but now I don't have to.

For all of those people who were worried about whether or not
the media would even question the raid, we owe it to the
NY Times (despite their rabidly anti-gun editorials) for 
being willing to talk to these 4 BATF  agents.
