       I don't think we've got a conspiracy on our hands, or anything
vaugely similar.  I do think that the Feds showed a distinct lack of
both intelligence and disregard for others safety throughout this whole
mess.

       I do think the FBI and the BATF screwed up big.  What made me
really concerned was FBI director William Sessions being on CNN engaging
in what could only be called spin control before the place had even
cooled down.  Evertyhing had literally blown up in their faces and I felt
there had to be something more important he should have been doing...
