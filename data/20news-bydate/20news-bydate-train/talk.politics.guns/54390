I thought that the Clipper Chip that was posted to t.p.g (sorry, I lost
the original post) was a joke.  I really did.  I didn't believe it for
a second.  But on the way to work this morning, I heard about it on NPR.

This scares me almost as much as the doublespeak emanating from the
FBI and BATF in Waco.
