	1. Make a new Newsgroup called talk.politics.guns.PARANOID or 
	talk.politics.guns.THEY'R.HERE.TO.TAKE.ME.AWAY

	2. Move all postings about waco and burn to (guess where)..

	3. Stop posting #### on this newsgroup

	We are all SO glad you're trying to save us from the evil 
	goverment, but would you mail this #### in regular mail to
	let's say 1000 people ????
	



	This is not a .signature.
	It's merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith
	and to bring down the evil Internet.
