Exactly, after all he was in the same party, probably just didn't want the
bad press that being directly associated with Duke would bring.  Conversely,
is his disdain for David Duke supposed to make us ideolize him?  I mean

I certainly know that I would refuse and openly denounce my Vice Presidency
if it meant putting him in control.
