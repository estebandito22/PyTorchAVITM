Branch Davidians was a resounding success.

Heil Clinton!  Heil Reno!  The Gestapo is alive and well and living in
Washington, D.C.

Kevin, who agrees that David Koresh was probably a first-rate nutcase
       but who firmly believes that the Bill of Rights guaranteed his
       his right to be a religious fanatic and that the government is
       guilty of violating his civil rights and of 1st degree murder.

       OK, which small, under-represented-in-congress religious group
       are we going to persecute next and are we going to torch their
       church with a rolled up copy of the Constitution?

       I think I'm going to be sick now. . .
