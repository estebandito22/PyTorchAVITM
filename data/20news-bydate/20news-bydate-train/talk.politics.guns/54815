I have also heard about HCI claiming thant anyone they  get an address
from is a member.  If this is the case their membership rolls are
grossly inflated and we should not call them and give them a name
and address to add to their already false rolls.  Perhaps
if you could get a copy of their existing membership, then pretend to
be an existing member, do that several thousand times, you could
hurt HCI.  But names are power.  Remeber the NRA uses the fact
that it has 3 million paid members in order to flex its muscles.

Perhaps politicians don't realize the lying tactics of HCI, wait a
minute, HCI learned it from politicians....

Later,
Josh
