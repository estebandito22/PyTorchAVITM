That's not all that Kratz doesn't know.

Now we know that Kratz doesn't understand what a safety is supposed to
do.  (He also confuses "things he can see" with "things that exist";
Glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the
outside.)

A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS that's
what the user wants.  With Glocks, one says "I want the gun to go
off" by pulling the trigger.  If the safeties it has make that work,
it has a "real" safety, no matter what Kratz thinks.
