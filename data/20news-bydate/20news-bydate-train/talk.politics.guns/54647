We've heard a lot of talk about brainwashing in Waco but the brainwashing
of the general population never ceases to amaze me. Here is an
example of action being taken which results in the worst possible
outcome and despite people's deep intuition telling them something
is wrong the programming will still cut in and say that the
agents probably acted in good faith. NO THEY DIDN'T. They either did
not have enough information to act in good faith or else they acted
knowing the risk. Sums up human stupidity all over and one of these
days it will destroy the fucking planet: "Oh sorry. Didn't think they
would respond by launching a strike. All our best calculations told
us they were bluffing."
