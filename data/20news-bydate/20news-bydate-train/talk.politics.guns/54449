I was shocked to see that the subject of my last rely to awesley was
"Luser!"  That was certainly not my intention.  I meant to leave the
subject line unchanged.  I believe that the NNTP server I use at columbia
must have put in that subject line in protest over problems with my header.
 That was rather rude of them, but beggars can't be choosers, I suppose.

In any case, I didn't do it and I apologize to awesley for the apparent
insult.
