   If you haven't heard yet, US Senator Patty Murrey, a Mom in
tennis shoes, is planning to introduce legislation to tax
all handgun transactions and increase dealer licnese costs in
order to raise money to cover the costs of un-insured shooting
victums.  She plans to start with $2500.00 per year dealer fees
and $40.00 or so, depending on the type of firearm, per gun
transaction.  She plans to make it federal.
   She was elected in Washington state under the trade mark as
just a mom in tennis shoes.  She can be written to via the
United States Senate, Washinton DC.  She is looking for your
tennis shoes.  So if you have a pair please send them to her
with your feelings regarding this tax.  
   She claims she has heard little from the opposition.

Lets inundate her!
