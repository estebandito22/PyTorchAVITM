Even if it were a capital offense, the warrant was not even an arrest warrant,
but a search warrant.  In other words, there was no evidence of illegal
arms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to
search for illegal evidence.

Question:  As in the Rodney King case, will the US DOJ institute
criminal civil rights proceedings against the BATF?  Or at least an
investigation?  OK, sorry I asked.
