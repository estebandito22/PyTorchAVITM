Seeing as how people are willing to quote the FBI quoting cultists
who just yesterday were deranged and not to be trusted (hmm the FBI
or the cultists...) I think I'll quote the BBC quoting (actually voice
interview) one of the two British survivors. He claimed that the fire
started when the tanks caused an internal wooden wall/roof to collapse
knocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan.

Maybe true, partly true, or false.
