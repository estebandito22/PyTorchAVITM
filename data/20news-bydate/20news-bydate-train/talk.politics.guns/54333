I will add my voice to the (hopefully) growing multitudes.

I hereby pledge $1000.00 towards the purchase of CNN, under the same conditions
as already described.  I will also post this idea on the other nets I can 
access (RIME and Libernet).

We may have to organize this ourselves, so I am looking for help.
