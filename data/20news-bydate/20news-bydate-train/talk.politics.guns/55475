Politicians want to eliminate private ownership of guns before the
general public starts violently resisting the tax increases needed
to fund the federal government as an ever higher percentage of tax
revenue goes to pay interest on the national debt (currently 57 cents
out of every tax dollar collected and rising).

I'm beginning to look forward to reaching the %100 allocation of taxes
to pay for the interest on the national debt. At that point the
federal government will be will go out of business for lack of funds.
