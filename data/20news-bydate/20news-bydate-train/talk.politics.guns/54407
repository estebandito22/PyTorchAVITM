In the interests of completeness, I thought readers of these 
newsgroups would want to see FBI Director William Sessions'
statement, as released by the FBI press office.

 FBI Director's Statement On Waco Standoff
 To: National Desk

   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- The following is a statement by 
FBI Director William S. Sessions regarding the Branch Davidian 
incident in Waco, Texas:

   "I had hoped to be making a very different statement this evening.
After very careful planning and extensive preparation we all thought
that today's efforts by the FBI to bring the Branch Davidians out of
their compound would result in the peaceful resolution of the
stand-off or at least meaningful negotiation.
   "Instead, we are faced with devastation and death.  However, I
have no question that our plan was correct and was conducted with
extreme professionalism and care.  I applaud the restraint shown by
agents in the face of life-threatening gunfire, and I thank them for
risking their lives to try to end this peacefully.  I have only the
greatest admiration for the courage and professionalism of all
involved."
