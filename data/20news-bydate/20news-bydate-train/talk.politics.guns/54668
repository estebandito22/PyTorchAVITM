     I HEARTILY agree.  Now that the BATF warrant has been 
     unsealed, it is CLEAR that Clinton and Reno supported an
     ILLEGAL raid.  Did they not KNOW this?



     NO authority for a 'no-knock" raid
     NO authority to use helicopters.
     NO authority to search for a "drug lab"

    And, apparently, not even any authority to search for "automatic
    weapons".
