    Actually all the liberals I've seen have deplored the burning of 
children. I would far preferred that the Davidians had not set the 
fire that burned themselves and their children to death, but I don't 
believe that the responsibility for the fire (or the almost complete 
absense of attempts to escape the blaze) can be placed at the door of 
the Federal authorities.

    Not so. My wife got me a convenient plastic "drip pan" for Christmas...

    Yeah, those Nazis. You know how we liberals just love those Nazis.

    Yeah, as information trickles in... funny how that works...
