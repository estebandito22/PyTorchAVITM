Actually, if I were one of the survivors and wanted to institute a civil
rights violation lawsuit against the Treasury Dept., I would claim that
the BATF/FBI itself was to blame for any mass hysteria/insanity...

without due process, the siegers shone lights, laser beams, multi-colored
spotlights, all the while playing loudly amplified music consisting of
everything from Tibetan Chant to Heavy Metal, and coupled with the fear,
the poor nutrition, the rampant paranoia, I'd say it was very likely
those poor nuts were made even nuttier.  After all, isn't sleep deprivation,
sensory overload, etc., part of the "new age" method of torture?
