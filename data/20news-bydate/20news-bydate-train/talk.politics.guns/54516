	That really depends upon where you draw the line while defining
these weapons, and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of
modern practice five months or five centuries down the road.  I'll give
you a little hint:  see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the
road?  In the USA, that is a weapon of mass destruction, biological in
nature, because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate
the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water.  So,
where do *you* draw the line?  In the USA, the EPA has ruled that
a pile of scrap iron is illegal.  Care to draw a thinner line this time?
