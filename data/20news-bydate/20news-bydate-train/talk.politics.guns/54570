...and I'm sure that people who were big fans of fuedalism pissed and
moaned about the emergence of the modern nation-state. Imagine, the King
allowing serfs their freedom if they could live in the city for a year!
Times change, technology changes, viable forms of social organization
change. While concerns about preserving Western notions of civil liberties
in the face of cultures with very different values is a valid one, it's
a waste of effort to try to turn back the tide. It's much smarter to focus
on trying to make sure that the emerging forms of social organization are
acceptable than it iss to lament the passing of the old forms.
