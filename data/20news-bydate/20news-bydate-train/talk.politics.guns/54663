Subject: Need Senate Bill numbers and House Resolution numbers
Lines: 30

Sorry for posting this here, but noone has replied to my post from the politics
side of the group.

I want to get involved in the fight to save our gun rights.  But first, I need
to get a little more educated.  I've been reading all the magzines and books I
can get my hands on, and sifting through hundreds of messages here in the 
Internet.

I want to obtain a COMPLETE list of Senate Bill and House Resolution
names/numbers.

Can anyone tell me how/where to obtain this info?  Surely there has to be a
way to obtain copies of anti-gun legislation from those *&%$#@'s in Washington.

Any help is appreciated.
