According to WNCI 97.9 FM radio this morning, Dayton, Ohio is operating a
gun "buy back".  They are giving $50 for every functional gun turned in.
They ran out of money in one day, and are now passing out $50 vouchers of
some sort.  They are looking for more funds to keep operating.  Another
media-event brought to you by HCI.

Is there something similar pro-gun people can do ?  For example, pay $100
to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm ?  Sounds a bit
tacky, but hey, whatever works.
