     It's not the NRA's fault; but it is something to consider if you are
considering contributing to the NRA. If candidate B is a complete asshole
whose only saving grace is that he opposes unnecessary restrictions on
firearms, I wouldn't want my membership dues funding efforts to get him
re-elected.

     I have other problems with the NRA (as an organization; the individual
members I've met have been loyal, trustworthy, honest, brave, etc.,
especially my boss who probably reads this newsgroup B->); they are
definitely pro-hunting, and I recall seeing a pro-Desert Storm NRA bumper
sticker. Sometimes they come on too strong in the political arena, which
contributes to their reputation as "bad guys" amoung many people.
