	The debate over the Second Amendment rages on.
Arguments continue over what a "well-regulated militia"
is and what TRKBA means in practical terms.  However, the
ONLY authority in this area, is a binding court decision
on the matter.  Even a decision in this area is subject to
an overturning by a higher court.  Is there anyone who
has the facts of a legal precedent, preferably a Supreme
Court decision on the specific meaning of the 2nd Amendment?
