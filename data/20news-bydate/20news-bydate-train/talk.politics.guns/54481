Our new Attorney General seems determined to do so. In the past
few days she has said:

	She hopes the King beating will not reduce public confidince
	in law enforcement.

	The tactics of using tear gas and driving tanks through
	walls in Waco were intended to further a "peacefull solution"
	to the crisis.

	Those same tactics were intended to prevent a mass suicide,
	but she never expected the sect to react by killing themselves.

It's comforting to know, at least, that she wasn't Clinton's first
choice...
