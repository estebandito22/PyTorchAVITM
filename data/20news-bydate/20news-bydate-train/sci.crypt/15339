   Excuse me?  This has *already* happened.  There's a couple of humps in
   the tent already.  Ask the folks at Qualcomm what became of the
   non-trivial encryption scheme they proposed for use in their CDMA
   digitial cellular phone standard?  There *already* are restrictions in
   place.

You have it slightly wrong. They dumped the encryption system because
they could not export it -- not because they could not produce it for
U.S. use. There are no legal restraints on citizen use of strong
cryptography -- yet.
