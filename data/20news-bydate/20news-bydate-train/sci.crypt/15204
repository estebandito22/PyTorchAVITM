How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without
being able to decode the traffic? i.e., In order to accuse me of using an
unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both
keys out of escrow, run them against my ciphertext and "draw a blank".

I can imagine the ciphertext exhibiting certain statistical
characteristics that might give a clue as to the encryption technique
used, but not enough to give a handle for diferential cryptoanalysis.
However, superencipherment or some other scheme that shapes the percieved
properties of my ciphertext could thwart this.
