The people on usenet are clearly a special bunch.  We live the net, which
is the future of our culture.  Usenetters have rapid electronic access to
information.  Society in general must depend on CNN.  

I can only hope we can make this information accessable by the public before
the radical fringe, which _is_ the majority, destroys the fabric of
this country.  Freedom is never easily won.
