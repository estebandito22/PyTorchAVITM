I don't know about classified, but I do seem to remember that unless
you're authorized by the Govt, it's illegal to TEMPEST-shield your

The NSA is now funding research not only in cryptography, but in all areas
of advanced mathematics. If you'd like a circular describing these new
research opportunities, just pick up your phone, call your mother, and
ask for one.
