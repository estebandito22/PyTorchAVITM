(a) To use for sensitive but not strategically important traffic,
(b) if the system was cheap.

For example, I don't own a cordless phone.  With Clipper, I would.  If the 
local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order 
pizza, I'm no worse off than I am now, and I don't have to worry about
local kids or nosy neighbors.

That is to say, Clipper "raises the bar" on insecure channels.  It doesn't 
make them secure, by any means, but a wall, even if the FBI can get a master 
key by court order, is still better than a "keep off the grass" sign.

So, where can I buy a DES-encrypted cellular phone?  How much does it cost?
Personally, Cylink stuff is out of my budget for personal use :)...

The Second and Fourth Amendments do come to mind.
