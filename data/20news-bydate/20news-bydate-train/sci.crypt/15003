   Better yet, instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system, take
it a step further.  Write yourself a minimal "file system" program that
is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a
directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.

   The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part
of the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all
allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the
partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd
partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach
might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS
system files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage 
unit of a "cluster" there is unused physical space on the disk between
the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These
dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file
system.

   Now you have a situation where no encrypted data "appears" on your
disk at all :-).
