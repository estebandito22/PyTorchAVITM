Well, it now seems obvious what Professor Denning was doing last fall
when this key escrow trial balloon was raised!

All the more need for end-to-end encryption schemes that bypass the
government-approved system.

By the way, the "Clipper" name...isn't this already used for the
Clipper processor from Intergraph? I doubt they're the ones making the
chip, so a name conflict may be present.
