Sounds to me like a *great* gimmick for a replacement market...every
so often issue a "Clipper Alert" announcing that some key backup tapes
are missing, that some Drug Lords got 'em, whatever. Then the owners
of these $1200 Clipperphones have to trot down to their local Key
Escrow Agency and buy new chips and have them programmed.

Microtoxin, the Clipper supplier, will make a killing...maybe this was
the real idea. (Anybody know if Janet Reno has stock in Microtoxin,
VLSI Technology, or AT&T?)

Could be a good opportunity to undermine this with some
disinformation: float rumors that the key database has been stolen.
All the chips need replacing. It angers people, undermines confidence
even more, and kills sales.

After the Waco Massacre and the Big Brother Wiretap Chip, any tactic
is fair.
