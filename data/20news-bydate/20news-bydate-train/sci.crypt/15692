Assume in this case the usual canard-adversary of narcotraficantes.  They
probably have more cash than the KGB did, and they're probably more generous
at handing it out.  It will be easier than ever to find or cultivate Walkers
and Pollards for the keys, and it will be easy enough to find someone to
reverse-engineer the chip (unless the tamper proofing is damned clever and
effective).
