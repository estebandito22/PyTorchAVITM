 So in a few years there could be millions of these chips in the USA, all
networked together? Sounds like a good science fiction story - the government
wants to crack foreign DES (or whatever) messages, so they con the public into
individually buying all of the components and installing them. Soon the US
could be covered by the largest parallel computer in the world, built on top of
our current phone net.
