I suggest that you refrain from such insults unless and until you can
produce some evidence to back up that claim.  Given the measures proposed
or passed in the last year or so, such as S.266 and the scanner ban,
her proposal need not be any more than her own attempt at a technical
solution.  It's entirely possible, in fact, that it was the notion of
splitting the key, which came up in the debate, that softened this proposal.
