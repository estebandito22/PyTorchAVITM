:    Does Dorothy Denning read this group?  If not, is someone on the group
: forwarding questions like these to her, or Martin Hellman, or anyone else
: who's seen more details about the chip?

Of course she does; it's just she's been toasted so often for being
an NSA patsy that she's keeping her head down.  You can always mail
her directly as denning@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu,
denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu or denning@cs.georgetown.edu
