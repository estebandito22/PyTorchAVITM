As usually, you are not reading. The proposal -does- say that it is a
"voluntary program". This doesn't make it more desirable, though...

"Secure"? How do you know? Because NSA is trying to make you believe it?
"Trust us." Yeah, right.

"Otherwise you are on your own"? How do you know that tomorrow they
will not outlaw encrypring devices that don't use "their" technology?
Because they are promising you? Gee, they are not doing even that -
read the proposal again.
