   Some sick part of me really liked that phrase....
 
   Actually, merely the threat of a *long* prison sentence, even without
a beating, can get most people to give in.  Especially if it's also
punctuated with a trip to the county jail, where one just happens to get
locked up with all the drunk/stoned/crazy folks that are too violent to be
left in cells with other people....
