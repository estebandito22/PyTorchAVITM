She hasn't.  Dorothy Denning has spent many years earning the
professional respect of her colleagues, and something won in this
manner is not easily lost.  Her support of the clipper -- no matter
how unpopular that position may be -- serves far more to enhance the
clipper's respectability than to diminish her own.
