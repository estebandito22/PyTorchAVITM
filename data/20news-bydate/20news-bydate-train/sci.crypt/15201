I sent a response to the White House at

	0005895485@MCIMAIL.COM (White House)

and received a nice, automatic reply from MICMAIL noting, in passing, that
if I had included a SNail address, I would get a reply in due course.

For those who care, my reply was:

	1.	yes, let's protect the voice network

	2.	privately-developed crypto has always been available and
		always will be -- so let's think about how to do law
		enforcement given that fact not about how to hope to
		legislate against it

	3.	my needs for crypto as a system designer are not met by the
		Clipper Chip.  I want freely to export uses of algorithms
		(like DES & RSA) which are already freely available in the
		destination country
