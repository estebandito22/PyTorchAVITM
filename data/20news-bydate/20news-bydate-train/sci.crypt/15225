I don't know if this is still true, but at one time Coca-Cola
took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret.  For instance,
several plants in different cities each made one of six partial
concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed
in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole
formula.  By now, I would guess that PepsiCo's chemists would have
reverse-engineered it; can't be all that exotic.  Actually I
prefer Pepsi anyhow; in about 3 minutes I'm gonna put money
into a Pepsi vending machine...
