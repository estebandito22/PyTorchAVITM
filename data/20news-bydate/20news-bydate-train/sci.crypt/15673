You seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value, and that
the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them.

Given this comparatively tiny number of wiretaps, and the associated
difficulty and cost involved (judges, technicians, etc) I expect that
law enforcement reserves the use of wiretaps for the most valuable
cases.  Since the "value" of an arrest can vary over an enormous range
(eg. jaywalking -> mass murder) I think your $5 million estimate may
be too low by a couple of orders of magnitude.
