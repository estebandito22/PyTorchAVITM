More than shocking.  What this says to me is no less than that government
is very interested in monitoring the public.  This does more than scare me,
it mortifies me.

PGP and RIPEM must become widespread enough to resist what Mr. Finney has
[IMHO correctly] identified as the next logical step.  What was once an
academic discussion with regard to concealing cyphertext, has now become
a real consideration.

The rhetoric that the clinton administration seems obsessed with, harmony,
either or propositions, tension, tells me that they know how difficult
it will be to sell this proposition.

The phrase I hear more and more is "I can't believe this is actually happening
here."  Call me conserative, Clinton was a huge mistake that we'll all be
paying for tommorow and many years from now.

Have we approached the age of speakeasy public key depositiories?
