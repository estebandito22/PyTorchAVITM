Hmmm, this could become a flame war very quickly.  The text is "...well
regulated militia..."  When that amendment was written and approved,
"regulated" meand "armed".  Remember all of those Westerns where bounty
hunters were called "regulators"?  This is now an archaic usage of the
word, but the original intent of the amendment was about weapons, not
control.
