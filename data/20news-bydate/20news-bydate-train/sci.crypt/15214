	I was thinking about this, also. It's quite possible the
system transmits, in clear, the serial number of the device being
used. That way they can start a tap, get the serial number, and use
the warrant for the first tap to get the key.

	If they tap someone who's apparently using encryption, but
don't find that prefix, then they'll assume it's an "un-authorized"
encryption scheme.
