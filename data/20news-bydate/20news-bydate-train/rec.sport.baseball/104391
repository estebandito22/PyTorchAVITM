I wish I hadn't sold my copy of Jewish Baseball Stars.  It's a Short Shelf
(i.e., the one on top of the toilet tank) Special.  The writing in that 
books is so astonishingly awful -- every sportswriting cliche taken to
the nth degree and then mangled -- that it's funny.

Rusinow is the author, I think.
