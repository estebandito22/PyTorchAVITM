Stankiewicz?  I doubt it.

Koufax was one of two Jewish HOFs: the other is Hank Greenberg.

Other good players: Buddy Myer, Johnny Kling, Norm and Larry Sherry,
Ken Holtzman, Saul Rogovin, Ed Reulbach.  

There have been over 150 Jewish major leaguers.  A few years ago there
was an article about someone who keeps track of this in Spy magazine;
the article was entitled "Jews on First," of course.

There have also been at least two books on the subject.
