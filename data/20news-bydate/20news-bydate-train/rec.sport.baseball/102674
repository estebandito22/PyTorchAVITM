While I enjoy the trend towards the more classic style of uniform - 
and I disagree with the person who wants a return to the non-gray road 
uniforms - it should be remembered that one of the, if not THE reason 
for the redesigning of uniforms, especially hats (re: the new road all 
green A's caps and the cardinal navy blue road cap), is the marketing 
money to be made in sales of new merchandise.
