	I believe SI had an in-depth article on Moe a while ago. I remember
	that the article revealed some new facts regarding the secretive
	Moe. My SI subscription expired this past February, the second of
	two years that I received same. Therefore my guess is that the
	article appeared sometime in 1991-92. 

	Can anyone else be more definitive as to a date of the SI article ?
