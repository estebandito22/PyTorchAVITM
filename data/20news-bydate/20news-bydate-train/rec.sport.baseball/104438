OK, the Mets and O's are good examples, but what about the '90 Reds?  Do you
really think that anyone expected them to sweep the A's?  I know people who
didn't even think they'd win a game, let alone win the Series.  We proved 
them wrong, though, didn't we?

As for this year, ignore their record now.  They've had a rocky start, and
that has nothing to do with Colorado.  They shall rise again.  The hunt for
a Reds' October continues. (with all due respect to WLW)  Bye.
