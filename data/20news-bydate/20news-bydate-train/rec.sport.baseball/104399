I made a mistake on the posted article [been fighting food
poisoning for last 24 hours...]

The second paragraph should state the following...

"Doctors cleared Sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball
on a tee and to catch a ball in his gloved hand."

Sorry for the error, didn't know it until after posting.
