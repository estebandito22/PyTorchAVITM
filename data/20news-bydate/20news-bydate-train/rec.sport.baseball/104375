Actually, for the Padres this year so far it's 23%.  They are 5th in
the league in HRs, and ALL have been solo shots.

Pythagorean projection puts them at .360 winning percentage
or 58-104.  Need some pitching help, fast!

Good news, though, is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs
w/o any pain.  Threw 80 pitches yesterday.  Should be back
in a couple of weeks.  Maybe we can trade him to the Yankees
for Militello.
