Being a baseball fan and a fan of the above mentioned band I was
wondering if anyone could clue me in on whether the Dead (or members
of) sang the national anthem at todays Giant opener?

I would imagine that it is a bit too early for anyone to know, but
an answer would be greatly appreciated.


             Curious,
                   Robert
