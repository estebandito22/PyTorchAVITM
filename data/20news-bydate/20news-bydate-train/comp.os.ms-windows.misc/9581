To get hierarchical icon groups in MS-Windows use Norton Desktop for Windows.

MS Windows in not mature. It's lousy. But its supposed to be lousy. It's
goal is to be ubiquitous not good. MS-Windows is the
course for the masses in IT Infrastructure 102. (DOS = 102, CP/M = 101.)

Unix was the course for the cogniscenti in IT Infrastructure 101. Together
they prove that there is good effect of good IT, and there is good effect
of ubiquitous IT. What we need, now is both at a significiantly higher
level of function. POSIX + DCE + CORBA + ????? ? See the problem?

NT may be IT Infrastructure 103, but it will also be IT Monopoly 102. (101
was IBM.)

We have a conundrum, gentlepeople. What are we going to do about it?
