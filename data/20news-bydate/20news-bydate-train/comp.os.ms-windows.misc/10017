It seems that a particular program designed for blind people is more important
than trying to interface windows with a way for blind people to use it.
If someone made a voice recognition/multimedia (sound) oriented program,
it would probably been more effective.  I don't know what the original
purpose of interfacing windows was for the person who posted the question
though.
