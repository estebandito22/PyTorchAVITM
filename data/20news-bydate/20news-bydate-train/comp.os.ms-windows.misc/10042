Title says it all: I'm in need of a Truetype OEM character set font - ie
one that contains the line drawing and other characters in the PC 
character set similar to those you get when running a text mode application.

If anyone could point me at such a thing, I'd be grateful.

[The only OEM fonts included with Windows are not Truetype.]

Regards,
