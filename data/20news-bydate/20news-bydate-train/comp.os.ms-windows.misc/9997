I am starting to work on a project using DDE to transfer data.  The 
application came with an Excel macro which can transfer the data.
I need to 'port' it to 1-2-3W.  1-2-3W uses a very different setup
for DDE macros.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to good references?  I have 
downloaded "WW01117:  Windows Dynamic Exchange (DDE)" [the MS
Application Note].  Any books worth getting?

The specifics are:

Server application:  Dionex AI-450 Chromatography Data System
Client application:  1-2-3 for Windows V1.1

Except for the macro, Dionex did not provide any documentation
for DDE.  Also, I am having problems because I am trying to develop
the application on my PC, but to actually get data, you need to be
connect to the instrument.  Any help here would be appreciated, too.

Thanks,
