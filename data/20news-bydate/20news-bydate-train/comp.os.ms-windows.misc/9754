Hi,
  I am working on gathering data on the way that users use
computers. This involves getting subjects to type and use a 
mouse. I want to be able to watch what they are doing without 
being in the same room. It would be ideal if I could watch
the session on another monitor without the subjects knowledge.
I believe that spliting the monitor cable will only work for
short distances, ie <5m. I will need to be approx 10m away, as
the cable travels.
  The PC's are connected to a TCP\IP network and run Windows 3.1.
Is there any software that will allow me to watch what is 
happening on another PC?
Thanks
Regards
