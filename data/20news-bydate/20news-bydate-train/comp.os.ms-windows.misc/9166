Be very careful with these results!  As I recall, numbers from Winbench
2.5 are calculated differently from 3.1, and so these figures are not
comparable.

However, to answer Stephen's question, replacing the Ahead B card with
a Diamond 24x will yield a cost-effective, dramatic speed increase for
Windows.  That or the ATI Graphics Ultra Plus....
