Is anyone out there running a MS-DOS system with a LocalTalk board? I am on an
Appletalk network, hooked up with a DayStar Digital LT200 MC LocalTalk
Interface Board, running on a PS/2 Model 70. I'm using the AppleShare PC
software for file server and network access. It works fine under DOS or the
Window or OS/2 DOS box. But when I try to load it *before* Windows, so that
every application I run could get access to it, the machine crashes hard as
soon as I start up an application. And of course, things look pretty hopeless
for OS/2 (but who knows). 

So, does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup?
