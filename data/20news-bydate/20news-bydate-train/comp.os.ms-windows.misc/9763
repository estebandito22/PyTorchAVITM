1) make sure your hard drive is defragmented. This will speed up more than 
   just windows BTW.  Use something like Norton's or PC Tools.
2) I _think_ that leaving the wall paper out will use less RAM and therefore
   will speed up your machine but I could very will be wrong on this.
There's a good chance you've already done this but if not it may speed things
up.  good luck
