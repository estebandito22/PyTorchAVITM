Hello,

We are having troubles using the PC/TCP onpredir (printer redirection program
with lpr support) with the Windows print manager. The onpredir simply waits
an do only the capture till the end of the Windows session, while after some
printer inactivity  it should start the printing.
 Does anybody uses this two programs together?

                                Thanks,
                                        Zsolt
