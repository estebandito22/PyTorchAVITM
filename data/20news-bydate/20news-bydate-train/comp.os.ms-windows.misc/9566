Is anyone familiar with a virus that infects the WINHELP.EXE file?

I have recently noticed some unusual system behavior and ran
Norton AntiVirus for WINDOWS.  It indicated a possible unknown
virus in the WINHELP.EXE file in both the MWINDOWS and WINOS2
directories.  Neither file changed since I installed my OS/2
system in January as far as I know.

Any information about this possible virus and suggestions on
remedies would be greatly appreciated.
