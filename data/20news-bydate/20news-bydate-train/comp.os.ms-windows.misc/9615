I have an Okidata 2410 printer for which I would like to have a printer driver.
Has anyone seen such a thing?  There is not one on the Microsoft BBS.
I can print to it from Windows but I have no fonts available and with
Paradox for Windows I can't print labels on it unless there is a proper printer
defined.


Thanks,
