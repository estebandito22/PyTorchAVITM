	Hello

I have a question about the demo files for amipro v3 uploaded in cica.
I downloaded it and tryied to install it.  However, it didn't work.  
In addition, it altered or eliminated my NWRES2.dll file so that I had
to reinstall my Norton Desktop again.

Is there anything I have to know to install it or do I eventually have 
to ask Lotus to send a working model to me (I heard that they have it)?
I just want to see its look and feel before buying it.

Any pointer would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you
