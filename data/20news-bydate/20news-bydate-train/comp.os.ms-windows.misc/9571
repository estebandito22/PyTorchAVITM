Subject: ?? DOS font size in windows??
Organization: NC State University
Lines: 13


	I have an 8514/A card, and I am using windows in 1024x768 mode 
	(normal 8514/A font, not small).  In the 386 enhanced mode
	the DOS window font is too small for my 14" monitor. Is there a 
	way to spacify the font size for the DOS window? You'll have to 
	excuse me if there is a trivial answer, since I am fairly new to
	MS Windows world.

	Thanks.
