Presumeably, you mean without a _permanent_ swap file. If Windows needs a
swap file, it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn't exist.
Permanent is generally faster though. I don't know why Mathcad wouldn't
be happy with either type--Ver. 3.0 is and so should any program conforming
to the Win specification.
