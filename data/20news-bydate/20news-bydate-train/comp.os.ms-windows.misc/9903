Subject: help: object appears thrice!
Summary: after editing win.ini [embedding..], and leaving only 1 entry
Organization: George Washington University
Lines: 40


Hey all...I got an equation editor, and since it didn't automagically
appear in my "object" dialog box (i.e. insert-->object-->equation), I
decided to manually place it there.  So I went into win.ini (is there
another way to do this?), the [embedding] section, and added 

equation=equation,equation,<path\filename>,picture.

didn't work.
quit windows, go back.  AHA: mistake. Correct it.  It looks fine.
start windows...doesn't work.  play with it for a while, at one point
having two entries to see if one works and th'other don't, and finally I
get it to work.  The only thing I can see that's different now is that
it's now the first item on the list, and it used to be the last.  But
now I end up with *three* "equation" entried, and *all* of them working.
(and only one entry in win.ini).

so does any netian know what's wrong? or rather, how to correct this?
(i.e. make "equation"appear but once?).

Also, all the entries in the [embedding] appear as above.
It's obvious that <path\filename> is the executable, or whatever, and
"picture" has something to do withthe way it appears
(picture/description?)

but what are the others?
i.e., in

soundrec=sound,sound,
whate's the difference between the 1st "sound" and the 2nd?  
and what is "soundrec"?? (I don't think it's the name of the executable,
as other entries (e.g. MSWorksChart=...) aren't)

thanks, i.a.
Mickey
