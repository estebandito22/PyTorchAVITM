Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver?
Sorry, don't know the version of the driver (no indication in the menus) but it's a recently
delivered Gateway system.  Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered
if anyone else had seen this.

post or email
