This may be a simple question but:

We have a number of PC's which we use to link to a mainframe using 
Novell LAN WorkPlace for DOS (via WIndows 3.1). 
Now, to make life easier for us we are thinking of using Windows for
Workgroups to allow file sharing across our PC network. 

Now does anyone know if it is possible to use W4WG and Lan Workplace
for DOS at the same time. 

ie Can I access a file on another PC while being logged on to the
mainframe at the same time, simultaneously.

Any help well appreciated.
