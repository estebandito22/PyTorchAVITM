// Hope I am in the right group! I'm using BC++'s ObjectWindows (version 3.1),
// trying to get some date processed in a window object. However, when invoking
// the window object, the calling program gives up the control to the window
// object, and keeps executing the next statement. The source code may look
// like the following:

class MyWindow : public TWindow
{
	...
};

void MyCallingProg(...)  // Could the calling program be a C function?
{	...
	MyWindow *MyWinObj;
	MyWinObj = new MyWindow(...);
	GetApplication()->MakeWindow(MyWinObj);
	MyWinObj->Show(SW_SHOWNORMAL);

	next statement;  // I want the program to wait here until MyWinObj is closed
	...              // so that I can get some data back from MyWinObj. 
	...              // I specified the window style to be WS_POPUPWINDOW, didn't
	...              // help. Is there any other way to execute the window object
	...              // so that the calling program won't give up the control?
}                   // Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!  --jun
