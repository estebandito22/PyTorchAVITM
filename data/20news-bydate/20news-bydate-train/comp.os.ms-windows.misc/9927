OK...I've heard rumors about this...I might have even seen it in a few places.
And I'd like some info...Is it possible to embed fonts in a document (Like 
Write, Word, or Ami Pro?) so the file can be printed on another machine that
doesn't have the font?  If possible, how is it done?

I'm sorry if this is a faq...I couldn't find a faq list...I would also 
apreciate knowing where that is...if a windows faq exsists.

Thanks in advance
