Somewhere in this thread, it has been said that Windows NT (tm) is a 
multi-user OS, as well as multi-threading, etc.  I certainly haven't
seen this to be the case.  There are seperate accounts for each person,
and even seperate directories if that is desired.  I don't see an 
implentation of simultaneuos use though.
