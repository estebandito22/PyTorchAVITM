Hi,

I have a 486/66MHz SYS based PC with 8M RAM and a problem.

What is the best way to configure high memory with QEMM/386MAX ??
I have a SPEEDSTAR 24X video card and use Hyperdisk disk cache
software. The problem is running Windows 3.1 in Enhanced mode and
having any high memory to load stuff high?

Note :
I tried, as recommended to exclude the region A000-C7FF but Windows
insists on starting in Standard mode.

Any suggestions?

Dan
