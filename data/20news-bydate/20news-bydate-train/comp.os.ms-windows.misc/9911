Summary: Help with changing Startup logo


I know this is probably a FAQ, but...

I installed the s/w for my ATI graphics card, and it bashed my Windows
logo files.  When I start Windows now, it has the 3.0 logo instead of
the 3.1 logo.

I thought the files that controlled this were

\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VGALOGO.RLE
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VGALOGO.LGO	

I restored these files, but it didn't change the logo.  Anyone know what
the correct files are?

Thanks.
