look on ftp.cica.indiana.edu for gws.....zip. They embed the release
number in the name, and I'm not sure what the lates is. It is Graphics
Workshop. There is a DOS and a Windows version. Both work Great. I even
had someone bring me some images from the Amiga, and converted them to
great looking wallpaper as 256-color .BMP files

If you can't find it, repost, or let me know, and I'll dig up the archive.
