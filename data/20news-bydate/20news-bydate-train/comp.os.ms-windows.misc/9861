My Problem: I wasn't aware of the fact that I would need an *SCSI*-CD-ROM for
Windows NT when ordering the Beta-SDK-Package. So my question: Is there any driver
available that will allow me to use my Mitsumi (Non-SCSI) CD-ROM for installation ?
If there is one, from which place (ftp-site) can I get it ?

Many thanks in advance
