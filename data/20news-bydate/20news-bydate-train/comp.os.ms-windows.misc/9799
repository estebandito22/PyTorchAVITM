Hi Everyone,

I would like to get an example program(source code) to get started with a simple
editor (similar to windows dialog editor, but lot simplified) . Can someone
point me to a source such as a programming windows book, or example program
comes with Windows SDK (from Microsoft or Borland). I would greatly appreciate
it.

All I want to do is to be able to place a edit control or combobox or a listbox
on a window and be able to drag and resize.

If anyone has written similar program and don't mind sharing code or ideas, 
I would appreciate it very much.

Thnx in advance, Manu Das

Please send me directly at manu@oas.olivetti.com
