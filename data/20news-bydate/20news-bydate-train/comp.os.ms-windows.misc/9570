I have two questions:

1) I have been having troubles with my Wordperfect for Windows.
   When I try to select and change fonts, etc. some of the text
   disappears.  I tried to center two lines once, and the second
   line disappeared.  I can not find the error, and I do not
   know how to correct it.

2) Is this the right newsgroup?  Where should I go?

E-mail prefered...
