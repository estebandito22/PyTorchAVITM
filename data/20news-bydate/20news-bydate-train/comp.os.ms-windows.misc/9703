	Yes, and it's pretty much what they claim.  I haven't had time to
try all of it.  Considering the price, even if you decide you don't like it,
it should be saleable over the next 2-3 months for what you have in it (once
the price goes up).  All in all it's very serviceable; and in my humble
opinion, more powerful than Access.
