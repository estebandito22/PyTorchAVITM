Here are some cool 3-D background patterns I made.

Edit your CONTROL.INI and add the following lines to your [Patterns] section.

Bricks=148 43 86 172 89 182 99 201
Tile=1 43 85 43 85 43 85 255
Tile (diagonal)=148 107 54 156 73 182 99 201
Slats=0 170 85 170 85 170 85 255

Make sure your desktop color is one of the standard 16 colors or the
patterns might not work.  I like dark grey the best with these.

If you have any cool one's of your own, please mail them to me.
