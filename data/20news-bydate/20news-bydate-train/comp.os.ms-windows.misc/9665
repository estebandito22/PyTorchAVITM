Hi
I'm having a problem with TrueType fonts in WIndows 3.1. I have installed
the Cyrillic fonts I found on CICA and now a strange thing happens:
Sometimes windows uses Cyrillic when its supposed to use Times Roman.
Examples: The PC-Tools Backup (version 7.1) has one line of Cyrillic text
in its opening banner, the next to last line. Importing a Word for Windows
text written in Times into WP5.2 also results in Cyrillic.
Does anyone have an idea where to look for the problem?
Thanks
