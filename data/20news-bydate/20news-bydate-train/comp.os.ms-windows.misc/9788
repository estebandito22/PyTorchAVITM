Subject: MS-Windows access for the blind?
Organization: [Computer Consoles, Inc., Rochester, NY

We are developing an MS-Windows based product that uses a full screen window
to display ~24 rows of textual data.  Is there any product for Microsoft Windows
that will enable blind individuals to access the data efficiently (quickly) ??

Please email responses and I will post a summary to this group.

Thanks for any help
