Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro 3.0 after running PCTools (v7.1)
compress?  I have not corrupted data due to having caches other than
PC-Cache running, so that is not it.  The first time I try to run Ami
Pro after loading windows, it loads, but causes (I think it was a) 
segmentation fault in AMIPRO.EXE right before it finishes, with all times
after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when
it begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in module
AMIPROUI.DLL at 0002:1147.  I have not been able to fix this problem except
by reinstalling Ami Pro.  This has happened twice, with both times being
after having ran compress on my hard drive.  BTW, I am not running stacker
or any other disk compression programs, and if you don't already know,
PCTools compress is actually a defragger, despite it's name.  My system is
a 386-40MHz, with 16MB of RAM and a NEC (OEM) hard drive, etc, but that
shouldn't make a difference.

PLEASE email me as I can't keep up with the newsgroup, and it will cut down
on net traffic anyways.  Thanks.
