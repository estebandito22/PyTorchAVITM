I have an IBM and run Windows 3.1.  A friend installed Norton Desktop For
Windows on top of this.  It loads automatically when I type "win", and
surely adds to the (already dismally slow) process of starting up.

I would like to know how to STOP or uninstall this program!!

I have taken it out of win.ini, but it still pops up running with windows.
I did a big search and found reference to it in ndw.ini, system.ini and
progman.ini.  Removing it here causes a failure when starting up windows
(progrman.ini has a "group 7 = ...ndw.exe..." which can't be deleted.)

Is there anyone familiar with NDW who can tell me how to turn it off??

		thanks!		Chet
