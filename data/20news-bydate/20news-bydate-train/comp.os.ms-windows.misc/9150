     Don't bother if you have CPBackup or Fastback.  They all offer options 
not available in the stripped-down MS version (FROM CPS!).  Examples - no 
proprietary format (to save space), probably no direct DMA access, and no 
tape drive!

     You NEED MS Defrag if you use doublespace to work on the compressed 
volume.
