Hi there,

We are running a 120 node Token ring with Windows 3.1 and Novell 3.11.

Every once in a while, we run into "The Black Screen of Death", a phrase
coined by Robert X. Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column.  

Basically, sometimes when you quit Windows, the screen goes black and
you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your
screen.  Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs.
Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows'
virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company
seems to know what I am talking about when I call them.

Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?  

Is there a fix for it?

Any response is welcome.
