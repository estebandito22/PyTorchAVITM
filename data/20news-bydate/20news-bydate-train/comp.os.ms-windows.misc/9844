Can somebody help me out there? I have just purchased Win 3.1 and I just
can't get DOS apps (text mode apps) to run in a window on their own. I've
tried mucking around with the PIF settings etc, but to no avail. What am
I doing wrong? (I didn't get this problem under v3.0).

Thanks in advance ...

Jason.
