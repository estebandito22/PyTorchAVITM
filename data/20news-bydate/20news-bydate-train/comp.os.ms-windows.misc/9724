While I do not speak for Peter Tattam, I am fairly sure he is planning a 
Winsock compliant version.  While this will definitely not make the initial
public release of WinTrumpet, it will follow on shortly thereafter.

Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta.  It looks like an excellent 
product, with several features beyond the DOS version.

WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP, Novell LWP, and there is also a direct to 
packet driver version that some people are using with the dis_pkt shim.
