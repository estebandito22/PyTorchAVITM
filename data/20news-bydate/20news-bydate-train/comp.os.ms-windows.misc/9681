Hi,
	We've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a
serial printer (dmp or Laser). I have used Works and Windows Write. The
output is OK from DOS and if I send plain text output, but anything
fancy garbles or just doesn't output. The exception is outputting to a
Lserjet 4 which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data, not to
bother about handshaking messages. I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I've
tried most of the Print/Network manager options I can think of. Anyone
had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it??
Thanks

John Atherton
