I know you said E-mail preferred but because this is a common problem
with WPWin I'll post it here.

The screen only LOOKS like the text is gone. Usually you can just
page-up then page-down and when it does a complete refresh the
text reappears. I have had--on "rare" occasions--to completely 
exit (save first) the program. When I reopened the file, all chaos
had been resolved. I don't know WHY it does this, but it is annoying.
The graphics problems have now made me a Word for Windows user!!
