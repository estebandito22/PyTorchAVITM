When I first setup windows using the self load mode It grabbed about
20 megs of swap file space, my 120 meg HD was nearly empty at that time.
I deleted windows for a time and recently reloaded, now my HD is nearly full
and windows just took 4 megs.
I have read somewhere that the best rule of thumb is have your
permanent swap file the same size as your regular RAM size.  I have 4 megs
of RAM and windows took 4 meg perm swap file.  Works very well.
In fact with my available HD space, about 20 megs it won't let me make
the swap file any bigger.
You should change your virtual mem swap file to 8 megs I think
that is what you said your RAM was.
