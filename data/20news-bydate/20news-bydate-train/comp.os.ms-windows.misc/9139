Are you using Windows 3.0 or 3.1? If you're still on 3.0, 3.1 devotes about
twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently. If 3.1,
you might use one of the resource monitors (such as the one that comes with
the Windows 3.1 Resource Kit or one of the many shareware ones available)
to see which programs are hogging the resources (every icon, internal
graphics brush, etc. in every program running uses a certain amount of
this limited memory area. Also, some don't give it back when they're
finished).
