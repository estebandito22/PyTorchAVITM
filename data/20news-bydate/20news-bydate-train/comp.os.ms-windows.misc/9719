I'm looking for a decent Windows news reader. I've given up on winvn 0.76
since it doesn't work very well with the winsock.dll of the IBM TCP/IP for
DOS 2.1.

What the status of Trumpet for Windows? Will it use the Windows sockets ?
I liked it in DOS but had to abandon it since I started using NDIS to access
our token ring (results in invalid class error :(


Bye!
