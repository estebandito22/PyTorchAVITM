Are there any Workspace Managers out there for Windows 3.1 ?
By a Workspace Manager, I mean something like the HP APOLLO Workstations
have - multiple workspaces under X.  There is a window at the bottom
of the screen which allows you to select different workspaces.
It overcomes the problem of having stacks of windows open on the one
screen.  Instead, you can spread them amongst different workspaces
which act like independent screens, and you can flick between them.
Thanks in advance.
