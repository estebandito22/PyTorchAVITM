Request for Information

I have been reading about an organisation called "WinWord Developer's Relations
Group".  I believe they have produced publications called WinWord Software
Development Kit (or WordBasic SDK) and 'The Proceedings of the Windows
Developers' Tools Conference, WordBasic' sessions assembled by Steve Wexler.

Would you be able to help me with a contact name and address for this
organisation or these publications.

Thank you
