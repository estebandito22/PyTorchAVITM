When I use the terminal software for Windows such as TERMINAL.EXE or 
Crossttalk, it doesn't use the whole window.  I mean, when the software's
window size is max, it still scrolls around the 2/3 of window.  It does not
use whole window.  I set "stty rows 30", but still the same. Scrolls at 2/3
from the top of the windows.  Could anyone tell me how to setup these software
to use whole window?

Thanks in advance.
