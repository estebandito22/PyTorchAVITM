Yes, and the idea was ripped off from Adobe, which has had a program
called  TypeAlign for a few years now.  TypeAlign does the same thing
for Adobe Type 1 fonts; *and* Adobe has said that the next version
will work with both Adobe Type 1 and TrueType.

And TypeAlign does some things that TrueEffects does not - including
some things you apparently want ...
