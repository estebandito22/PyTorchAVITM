I wonder if anyone can tell me whether or not I can create a bitmap
of any size?  I followed the bitmap creation example in SDK manual
and specified a 24x24 bitmap (set the width/height to 24) and supplied
a byte string with 72 chars.  But I just cannot get the right bitmap
image.  I changed the width/height to 32x32 and used the same value
string (padded with zero byets to make up to the right size) and
got the image.

The example in the manual is 64x32 size, which are multiple of 2 bytes.
Can you define a bitmap image of any size?

Thanks very much.
