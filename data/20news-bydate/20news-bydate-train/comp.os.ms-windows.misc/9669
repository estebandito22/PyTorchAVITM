I have a small Windows program which I can not get to work; 
The program looks vaguely like this:

=============================================
char f1[80];

int WinMain(...
{
  lstrcpy ((LPSTR)f1, "Hello");
  ...
}

long far pascal WndProc(...
{
  lstrcpy ((LPSTR)f1, "Hello");
  ...
}

============================================= 
I am using large model under Windows 3.1; after linking without
errors, the RC program said

Sorting preload segments and resources into fast-load section
Copying segment 1 (53679 bytes)
RC : fatal error RW1031: Segment 1 and its
     relocation information is too large for load
     optimization. Make the segment LOADONCALL or
     rerun RC using the -K switch if the segment must
     be preloaded.

Using the -K switch seems to interfere with the proper function of
the second lstrcpy call... can anybody explain what is going on and/or
how to fix it?


Thanks...
