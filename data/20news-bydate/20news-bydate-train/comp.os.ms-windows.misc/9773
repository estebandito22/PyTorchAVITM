	I'm attempting to transfer files from my home computer running
Windows 3.1 Terminal to a workstation at school.  The file transfer protocol
at home is Kermit for binary files.  I'm running Kermit on the workstation at school and
setting the file transfer protocol to binary.  I am unable to upload files
to school but can download files from school to home.  During download,
Terminal displays ther retrying message several times then the message '
Verify you're using the correct protocol'.  
	Anyone have any ideas on how to fix?  Either e-mail or post to this
group. 

Thanks, in advance,
