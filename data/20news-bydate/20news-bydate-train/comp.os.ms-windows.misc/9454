Lots of drivers are available off ftp.cica.indiana.edu in pub/pc/win3/
drivers/video. I've tried two: et4cview.zip and et4turbo.zip. These
give you a choice of turbo and non-turbo drivers. The turbo drivers
were FAST but caused mouse problems with my machine (which has a
Diamond Speedstar card). I finally got turbo drivers (wndSpeed by
Binar) from Diamond. Amazing. Blazingly fast (for a non-accelerated
card) and best of all - no GPF's for a month or so...
