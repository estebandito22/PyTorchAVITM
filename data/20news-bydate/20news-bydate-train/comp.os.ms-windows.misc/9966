backdesk.zip is on CICA, but I'm not sure of the whole directory.

Another to throw into the running is topdesk.  It is alsow on CICA, but
I'm not sure where.  It is more complicated then backdesk, but I've found
it to be more stable and more usefull.  I recomend it to people who
have already used a virtual desktop.  Oh yeh, It's free.
