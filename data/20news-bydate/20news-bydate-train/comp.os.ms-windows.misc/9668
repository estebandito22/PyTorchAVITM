Software that comes together with the VideoBlaster
is designed to work together with the SoundBlaster
(from the same manufacturer).

Since I do not own a SoundBlaster: is there a possibility
to use the PC Speaker driver to play audio files for
the VideoBlaster (.AVI = audio video interleave files) ?

I think what I should have is a device driver for
the Media Player that controls the PC Speaker Driver
instead of the SoundBlaster card (something like MCISPKR.DRV).

Has anybody heard of such a driver?
Or am I on the wrong track?

Any information on this appreciated!
