Subject: Utility to expand DOS file descriptions in directory listing?

I am looking for a Windows Utility that would give me a listing of files
in a directory, but also display a description of the file.  This utility
would allow me to enter and edit file descriptions of, hopefully, any 
length (maybe a small window with a scroll bar?).  I would then be able
to browse my directories and be able to see what is in a file without
having to open or execute it.  Any such beast out there?  If not, anyone
want to write one?
