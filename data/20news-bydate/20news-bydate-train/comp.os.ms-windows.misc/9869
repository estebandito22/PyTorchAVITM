No, not really. It may be that your winfile.ini has gotten corrupted for
some unknown reason. Have you tried re-creating it by either
1.exiting filemanager with the save setting option on when the status bar
is visible,
or
2.double clicking on the Control menu(the one with minimize and maximize
in in) when everything looks proper?

If you have, and it still doesn't work, you may want to delete your
winfile.ini and try one of these two saving procedures again to totally
recreate the file from scratch.

Good luck!
