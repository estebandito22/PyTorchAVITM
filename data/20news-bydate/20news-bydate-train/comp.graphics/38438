    Help!! I need code/package/whatever to take 3-D data and turn it into
a wireframe surface with hidden lines removed. I'm using a DOS machine, and
the code can be in ANSI C or C++, ANSI Fortran or Basic. The data I'm using
forms a rectangular grid.
   Please post your replies to the net so that others may benefit. IMHO, this
is a general interest question.
   Thank you!!!!!!
