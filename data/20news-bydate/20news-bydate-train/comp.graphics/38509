Hi.

The RTrace ray tracer supports 3D text as a primitive, not collections of
spheres, cylinders and so on...
The 3D chars are made of lines and splines that are extruded...

Please have a look at asterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17] in directory
pub/RTrace.
In pub/RTrace/tmp there are some demo images with high quality text.
All of them are called Text?.jpg (JPEG encoded). See them first and then
tell me what you think.

Regards,
Antonio.
