     If you have the GRASP animation system, then yes, it's quite easy.
You simply use GLIB to extract the image (each "frame" in a .GL is
actually a complete .PCX or .CLP file), then use one of MANY available
utilities to convert it.  If you don't have the GRASP package, I'm afraid
I can't help you.  Sorry.
     By the way, before you ask, GRASP (GRaphics Animation System for
Professionals) is a commercial product that sells for just over US$300
from most mail-order companies I've seen.  And no, I don't have it.  :)
