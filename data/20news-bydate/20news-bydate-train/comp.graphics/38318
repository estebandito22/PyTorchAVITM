Sorry about not mentioning platform... my original post was to mac.programmer,
and then decided to post here to comp.graphics.

I'd like the 3D software to run on primarily Mac in either C, Object Pascal
(Think or MPW). But, I'll port to Windows later, so a package that runs on
Mac and has a Windows version would be ideal.

I'm looking for a package that has low upfront costs, and reasonable licensing
costs... of course :)
