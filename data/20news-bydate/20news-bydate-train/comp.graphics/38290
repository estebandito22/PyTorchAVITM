Hi!

I am looking for the email address of the author to
"A Generic Solution to Polygon Clipping", 
Communication of the ACM, July 1992, Vol. 35, No. 7. 
I got information about the author as follows
	Mr. Bala R. Vatti
	LCEC, 65 River Road, Hudson, N.H. 03051
	email: vatti@waynar.lcec.lockheed
I want to get some related and detailed papers about the
same topic from the author. But I failed to send my email 
to the address. Any information is appreciated.

Thank you very much.

Best regards.
