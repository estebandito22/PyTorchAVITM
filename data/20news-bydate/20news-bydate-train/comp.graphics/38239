Up until last week, I have been running POVray v1.0 on my 486/33 under DOS5
without any major problems.  Over Easter I increased the memory from 4Meg to
8Meg, and found that POVray reboots the system every time under DOS5.  I had
a go at running POVray in a DOS window when running Win3.1 on the same system
and it now works fine, even if a lot slower.  I would like to go back to 
using POVray directly under DOS, anyone any ideas???
