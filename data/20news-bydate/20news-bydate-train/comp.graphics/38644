I need the file format for cc:Mail file formats - it seems to be PCX-based,
but with a twist: only the first page of a multi-page fax will come out
readable. The other pages disappear. The format seems to be 'proprietary'.

Anybody got any clues? I have to give my email FAXes to my secretary in
order to get 'em unscrambled. I want a filter from cc:Mail to .p[nb]m.

Come to think of it, p[nb]m to cc:Mail would be nice too.
