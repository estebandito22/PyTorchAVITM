Hi net!
Due to further investigation I would like to study the following article:
	Peterson, "Ray tracing general B-Splines",
	Proc. ACM Mountain Regional Conference, April 1986
Unfortunately I didn't find it in any library's register.
If there is anyone having access to this paper or knowing about a
library containing those proceedings (preferrably in Germany), please 
let me know! Any help would be appreciated! 

Thanks a lot, 
Joerg Haber
