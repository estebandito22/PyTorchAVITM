I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this question.  If not,
please forgive me and point me in the right direction.

Does anybody know of a program that converts .GIF files to .BMP files
and if so, where can I ftp it from?  Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.

Please respond via e-mail as I do not read this group very often.

Thanks...Scott
