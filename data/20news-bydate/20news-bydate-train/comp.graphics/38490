Hi ... Recently I found XV for MS-DOS in a subdirectory of GNU-CC (GNUISH). I 
use frequently XV on a Sun Spark Station 1 and I never had problems, but when I
start it on my computer with -h option, it display the help menu and when I
start it with a GIF-File my Hard disk turns 2 or 3 seconds and the prompt come
back.

My computer is a little 386/25 with copro, 4 Mega rams, Tseng 4000 (1M) running
MS-DOS 5.0 with HIMEM.SYS and no EMM386.SYS. I had the GO32.EXE too... but no
driver who run with it.

Do somenone know the solution to run XV ??? any help would be apprecied..
		
	Thanx in advance !!!!
