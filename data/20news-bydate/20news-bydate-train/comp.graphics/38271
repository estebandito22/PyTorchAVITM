 Recently I saw the latest Computer Shopper and in it there was an article
on nice shareware graphics programs. They looked pretty good and of the 6
listed in the article, one I had (Graphics Workshop), one I found via
archie (Draft Choice - old version though) and the rest I couldn't find.
So if there is anyone that knows where I can get the following programs
via anonymous ftp, please let me know.

Adkins Graphics :AG1.ZIP, AG2.ZIP
Draft Choice (latest VGA version) : DRAFTC.ZIP
Envision Publisher: ENVIS1.ZIP, ENVIS2.ZIP
Neopaint: NEOPNT.ZIP

Thanx in advance.
