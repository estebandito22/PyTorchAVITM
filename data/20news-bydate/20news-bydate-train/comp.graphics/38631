I also use Graphic Workshop and the only differences that I know of are that
Hijaak has screen capture capabilities and acn convert to/from a couple of
more file formats (don't know specifically which one).  In the April 13
issue of PC Magazine they test the twelve best selling image capture/convert
utilities, including Hijaak.
