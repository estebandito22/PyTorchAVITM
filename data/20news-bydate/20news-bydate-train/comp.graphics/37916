        I recently got a file describing a library of rendering routines 
called SIPP (SImple Polygon Processor).  Could anyone tell me where I can 
FTP the source code and which is the newest version around?
        Also, I've never used Renderman so I was wondering if Renderman 
is like SIPP?  ie. a library of rendering routines which one uses to make 
a program that creates the image...

                                        Thanks,  Joe Tham
