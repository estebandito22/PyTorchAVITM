gnuplot, etc. make it easy to plot real valued functions of 2 variables
but I want to plot functions whose values are 2-vectors. I have been 
doing this by plotting arrays of arrows (complete with arrowheads) but
before going further, I thought I would ask whether someone has already
done the work. Any pointers??

thanx in advance
