Hi!
	I am working on a project that needs to create contour lines
from random data points.  The work that I have done so far tells me that I
need to look into Triangulated Irregular Networks (TIN), the Delauney
criiterion, and the Krige method.  Does anyone have any suggestions for
references, programs and hopefully source code for creating contours.  Any
help with this or any surface modeling would be greatly appreciated.
I can be reached at the addresses below:
