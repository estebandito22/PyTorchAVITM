Hi Everyone--

  It's spend-the-money-before-it-goes-away time here at U.Florida
and we need to find some PC-based software that will do contour
plotting with irregular boundaries,i.e., a 2-D profile of a soil
                                    system with a pond superimposed
                /-----------------  on it.  We've given SURFER a
    POND      /                  |  trial run but it interpolates
            /                    |  contours out into the pond and/or
----------/                      |  creates artifacts at the borders.
|              SOIL              |  If anyone out there knows of a
|                                |  product, I'ld appreciate hearing
|________________________________|  about it.  If there is enough of
a response, I'll post a summary.  Thanks -- (and now back to lurking).
