Peter,  there's a radiosity package ahead. The only problem is: there 
are a few miles to sail ... ;-^

Let's be serious... I'm working on a radiosity package, written in C++.
I would like to make it public domain.  I'll announce it in c.g. the minute
I finished it. 

That were the good news. The bad news: It'll take another 2 months (at least) 
to finish it. 

In the meantime you may have a look at the file
  Radiosity_code.tar.Z
located at
  compute1.cc.ncsu.edu

(there are some other locations; have a look at archie to get the nearest)

Hope that'll help.

Yours

Stephan
