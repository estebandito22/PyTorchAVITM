There is a vast literature on Delaunay triangulations, literally
hundreds of papers.  A program is even provided with every copy of 
Mathematica nowadays.  You might look at this if you are interested in 
using it for creating 3D objects:

@article{Boissonnat5,
  author = "J.D. Boissonnat",
  title = "Geometric Structures for Three-Dimensional Shape Representation",
  journal = "ACM Transactions on Graphics",
  month = "October",
  year = {1984},
  volume = {3},
  number = {4},
  pages = {266-286}
}
