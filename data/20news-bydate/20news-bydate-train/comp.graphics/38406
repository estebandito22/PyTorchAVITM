Looking for a graphics/CAD/or-whatever package on a X-Unix box that will
take a file with records like:

n  a  b  p

where n = a count  - integer 
      a = entity a - string
      b = entity b - string
      p = type     - string

and produce a networked graph with nodes represented with boxes or circles
and the vertices represented by lines and the width of the line determined by
n.  There would be a different line type for each type of vertice. The boxes
need to be identified with the entity's name.  The number of entities < 1000
and vertices < 100000.  It would be nice if the tool minimized line
cross-overs and did a good job of layout.  ;-)

  I have looked in the FAQ for comp.graphics and gnuplot without success. Any
ideas would be appreciated?

Thanks,
