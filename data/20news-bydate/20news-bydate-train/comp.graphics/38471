	Does anyone know the phone number to a place where i can get
a VGA passthrough?

	I want to hook up my VGA card to my XGA card (whcih you can can).
All I need is the cable that connects them.  It is the same type of
cable that you would connect from your VGA card to say a Video Blaster
or something.

	Thanks.
