RIX's files with the extension  .sci and .scf are just a RAW file with
a 256 color palette.
The first 10 bytes is a kind of header, with the name RIX among 7bytes unknown stuff. The you have 768 bytes of palette info (3*256 for the colors RGB)
and then you have the picture in raw format.
If you dont know how to make a viewer of of this description you can get VPIC
it is able to read the files!
