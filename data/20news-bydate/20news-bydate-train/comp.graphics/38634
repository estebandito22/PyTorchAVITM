 Hello,

Hello,

     I was wondering if anyone knew of a PC or MAC
implementation of the marching cubes algorithm that will output
the individual faces.  If there is no such application, might there
be some C source code that I could modify to implement the
algorithm and get to the individual faces.

Thanks in advance
Sincerly

Tracy
