When using Photoshop is there anyway to get an elliptical dot for the
halftone screen rather than a round dot ? My printer would prefer an
elliptical dot, but I'm not sure how to set it up. I'm sending from a Mac
IIci to a Linotronic L300 imagesetter and I am using Photoshop 2.0.1 to
make my separations.

Any help would be greatly appreshed. T.I.A.
