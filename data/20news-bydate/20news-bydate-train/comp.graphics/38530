I downloaded an image of the earth re-constructed from elevation data taken
at 1/2 degree increments. The author (not me) wrote some c-code (included)
that read in the data file and generated b&w and pseudo color images. They
work very well and are not incumbered by copyright. They are at an aminet
site near you called earth.lha in the amiga/pix/misc area...

I refer you to the included docs for the details on how the author (sorry, I
forget his name) created these images. The raw data is not included.
