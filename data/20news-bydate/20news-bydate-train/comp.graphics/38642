:  Actually the most flexible way to create temp files is to check for a TEMP or
: TMP environment variable and create the files on the drive and directory pointedto by the variable.  This is pretty much a standard for DOS, Windows and OS/2
: applications.

Unfortunately, cview does not pay attention to the temp environment variable.
