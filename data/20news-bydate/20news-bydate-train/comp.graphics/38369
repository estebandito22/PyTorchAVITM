I'm interested in simulating reverse (or negative) color video
mathematically.  What is the transform?  Is it a simple
reversal of the hue value in the HSV color space?  Is it
a manipulation in the YUV color space?  How is it related
to solarization?

If you want to see something truly wild, turn on the
reverse video effect on a camcorder so equipped,
and point it at the monitor.  This creates a chaotic
dynamical system whose phase space is continuous along
rotation, zoom, focus, etc.  Very very surprising and 
lovely.  I'd like to write a simulation of this effect
without analog grunge.  Thanks for any info you may have.

Please e-mail any info to me.  I'll post a summary.

Thanks,
