: Ho boy. There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do

Ummm, I beg to differ. A kind soul sent me a program called DPG-VIEW that
will do exactly what I want, view GIF images under Linux without X-Windows.
And, it does support all the way up to 1024x768. The biggest complaint I
have is it is painfully SLOW. It takes about 1 minute to display an image.
I am use to CSHOW under DOS which takes a split second. Any idea why it
is so slow under Linux? Anybody have anything better? Plus, anybody have
the docs to DPG-View? Thanks!
