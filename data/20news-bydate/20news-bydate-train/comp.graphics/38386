Hi,

well I have opened up a FTP site for getting the latest software drivers
for Genoa graphics cards.

Here is how to access it:

ftp 192.109.42.11
login:ftp
password:ftp
cd pub/genoa
ls -l
binary
prompt
hash

(now if you wanna have the latest drivers for the 7900 board)

cd 7000series
mget *

quit

This is the sequence to get the drivers.

If you have any further question, please email me.

Best regards, Stefan Hartmann
