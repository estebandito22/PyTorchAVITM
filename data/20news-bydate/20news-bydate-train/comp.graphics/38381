I am working on a project where we are going to be including
both still and moving grapics within a database.  Of course
JPEG and MPEG come to mind as the formats of choice for the
various files.  However, from what I read on the Net, it seems
as if there are several different forms of each of these.

What I want to do, is settle on a file format which I can count
on as being a standard format 10 years from now.  I know Apple is going
to support Quicktime on the new Power PC's and, so this
may be the format of choice.

What format does Apple's Quicktime use for their products?  I guess
it is some kind of MPEG for their motion picture. Is it any different
than standard MPEG files?

Thanx for any info!
