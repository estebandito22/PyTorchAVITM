I don't want texture mapped, cause if I did I'd asked for them. :)  Just
a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons.  As for the processor, it'd
be for a minimum of a 286... maybe 386 if I can't find a good one for 286s.
Ideally, I want a polyn function that can clip to a user-defined viewport,
and write to an arbitrary location in memory.  Of course the chances of
finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source
with it.  Oh, and I guess it would need to be in ASM otherwise it'd be too
slow.  I've seen some polygon routines in C, and they've all been waaay too
slow.  Its for a 3D vector graphics program.  I've been hunting high and low
for a polyn function in ASM, and I can't find one anywhere that I can use.
I've found one or two polyn functions, but my ASM is pretty bad, so I won't
even try to rewrite them. :)
