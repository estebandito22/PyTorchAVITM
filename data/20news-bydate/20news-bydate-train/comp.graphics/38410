Hi again,

Many thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a MS-
Windows screen grabber.  It proves to me AGAIN that the net is a 
wonderful thing.  :-)

So, in summary:

There are two choices:

1)	Various screen grabber packages (Corel Draw has one, there are
a couple on simtel and cica).

2)	Use the built-in PrintScreen and Alt-PrintScreen functionality
to paste the screen (or window) to the clipboard.  Then paste the 
clipboard to your application.  Cool!

Again, thanks for the info...

Grant (the MS-Windows newbie -- Unix and X are my bag ;-)
