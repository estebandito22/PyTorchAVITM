Subject: Why does Illustrator AutoTrace so poorly?

I've been trying to figure out a way to get Adobe Illustrator
to auto-trace >exactly< what I see on my screen. But it misses
the edges of templates by as many as 6 pixels or more - resulting in images
that are useless  - I need exact tracing, not approximate.

I've tried adjusting the freehand tolerances as well as autotrace
tolerances but it doesn't help. Any suggestions?
