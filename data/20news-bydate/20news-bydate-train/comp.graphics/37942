Hi!  I am in immediate need for details of various graphics compression
techniques.  So if you know where I could obtain descriptions of algo-
rithms or public-domain source codes for such formats as JPEG, GIF, and
fractals, I would be immensely grateful if you could share the info with
me.  This is for a project I am contemplating of doing.

Thanks in advance.  Please reply via e-mail if possible.
