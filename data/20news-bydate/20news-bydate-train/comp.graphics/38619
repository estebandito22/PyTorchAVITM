Hello,

Can anybody help me with the conversion of pic format files
to HPGL files. The question is as follows:

Is it possible to convert files that have been generated in the
pic preprocessor format into HPGL format, suitable for sending
to a plotter. The hardware involved is IBM RISC/6000 running AIX
3.2.3. How should this be done and what software is involved,
where is it available, what does it cost, what are the problems?

Regards,

Dani
