RADIOSITY SOURCES WANTED !!!
============================

When I read the comp.graphics group, I never found something about 
radiosity. Is there anybody interested in out there? I would be glad 
to hear from somebody.
I am looking for source-code for the radiosity-method. I have already
read common literature, e. g.Foley ... . I think little examples could 
help me to understand how radiosity works. Common languages ( C, C++, 
Pascal) prefered.
I hope you will help me!

Yours
Peter
