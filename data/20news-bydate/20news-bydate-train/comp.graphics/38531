	It depends on what kind of the polygons. 
	Convex - simple, concave - trouble, concave with loop(s)
	inside - big trouble.

	Of cause, you can use the box test to avoid checking
	each edges. According to my experience, there is not
	a simple way to go. The headache stuff is to deal with
	the special cases, for example, the overlapped lines.
