Hello,

    I have been searching for a quality image enhancement and
    manipulation package for Unix/X/Motif platforms that is comparable
    to Adobe Photo Shop for the Mac.

    I have not been able to find any, and would appreciate any
    information about such products you could provide.

    I would be particularly interested in software that runs on HP or
    Sun workstations, and does not require special add-in hardware, but
    would also be interested in other solutions.


Thank You.
Wayne
