I am interested in any information on stereoscopic imaging on a sun
workstation.  For the most part, I need to know if there is any hardware
available to interface the system and whether the refresh rates are
sufficient to produce quality image representations.  Any information
about the subject would be greatly appreciated.

    Thanks!
