I can't fiqure this out.  I have properly compiled pov on a unix machine
running SunOS 4.1.3  The problem is that when I run the sample .pov files and
use the EXACT same parameters when compiling different .tga outputs.  Some
of the .tga's are okay, and other's are unrecognizable by any software.

Help!
