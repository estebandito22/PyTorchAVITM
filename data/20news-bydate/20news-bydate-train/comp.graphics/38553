I am working on a program to display 3d wireframe models with the user
being able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters.  Also,
the wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes so
that they can move around while the user is "exploring" the wireframe
world.

To do this, I am thinking of using the SRGP package described in the
Van Dam, Foley and Feiner book, but I was wondering if there was
another PD graphics package out there which was faster.  I would like
to make the program as fast as possible so that it provides
satisfactory real time performance on a Sun IPX.

Ideally, I'm looking for a PD graphics package which will allow me to
open a new window under X, and allow me to draw lines within the
window.  Also, it would also need to have some sort of event driven
interaction handling since the user is going to move around the
wireframe models using the keyboard.

If you know or wrote such a package, I would be grateful if you could
direct me to a ftp site which contains the package.

Thank you.
