In all fairness, how many people do you know personally who read images
from Floppy drives?  I haven't tried it with JPEGs, but I do realize how
agonizingly slow it is with GIF files.  

Nevertheless, it is an important bug that needs to be squashed.  I am
merely pointing out that it was probably overlooked.  While it is serious,
one must keep in mind that it will probably affect at most 5% of the
targeted users of CView.
