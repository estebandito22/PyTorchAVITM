I'm interested in find out what is involved in processing pairs of 
stereo photographs.  I have black-and-white photos and would like 
to obtain surface contours.

I'd prefer to do the processing on an SGI, but would be interested
in hearing what software/hardware is used for this type of
image processing.

Please email and/or post to comp.sys.sgi.graphics your responses.

Thanks,
