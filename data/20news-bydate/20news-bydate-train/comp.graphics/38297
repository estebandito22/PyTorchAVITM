A book that I can somewhat recommend is :
                     
                     Pratical Image Processing in C
                     by Craig A. Lindley
                     published by Wiley

It addresses reading/writing to/from PCX/TIFF files; image acquisition, 
manipulation and storage; and has source code in the book. The source is 
primarily written in Turbo C and naturally has conversion possibilities. I 
have converted some of it to Quick C. Naturally, the code has some problems 
in the book - as usuall. Typos, syntax, etc. are problems. It can be a good 
learning experience for someone who is studying C. There is also a companion 
disk with source available for order and $50.00. Overall, the book is not 
bad. I acquired the book at WaldenSoftware.
