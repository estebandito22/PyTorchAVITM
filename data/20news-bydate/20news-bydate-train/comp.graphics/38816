Subject: 3DS: Where did all the texture rules go?
Lines: 21

Hi,

I've noticed that if you only save a model (with all your mapping planes
positioned carefully) to a .3DS file that when you reload it after restarting
3DS, they are given a default position and orientation.  But if you save
to a .PRJ file their positions/orientation are preserved.  Does anyone
know why this information is not stored in the .3DS file?  Nothing is
explicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in the .PRJ file. 
I'd like to be able to read the texture rule information, does anyone have 
the format for the .PRJ file?

Is the .CEL file format available from somewhere?

Rych
