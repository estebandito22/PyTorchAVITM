Organization: University of Newcastle, AUSTRALIA
Lines: 11

Does anybody out there have or know how to calculate the RGB values 
required to set the 256 color VGA palette so that the colors from 
0..255 will give 256 colors  of the rainbow ie red, orange, 
yellow, etc.

Any help would be appreciated. Please email to eeerik@cc.newcastle.edu.au
