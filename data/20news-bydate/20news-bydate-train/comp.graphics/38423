Excuse the sheer newbieness of this post, but I am looking for a decent
PaintProgram which will save to various file formats (.BMP  .PCX  etc etc)
via ftp, freeware, or shareware.  I would like to check out the available
programs for little $$ before I check out the commercial market.

Thanks in advance for any help or direction you can give me.
