Hi,
         I have a friend who is working on 2-d and 3-d object recognition. He is looking
for references describing algorithms on the following subject areas:

Thresholding
Edge Segmentation
Marr-Hildreth
Sobel Operator
Chain Codes
Thinning - Skeletonising

If anybody is willing to post an algorithm that they have implemented which demonstrates
any of the above topics, it would be much appreciated.

Please post all replies to my e-mail address. If requested I will post a summary to the
newsgroup in a couple of weeks.


Thanks in advance for all replies
