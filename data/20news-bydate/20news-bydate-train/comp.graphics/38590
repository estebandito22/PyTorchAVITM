I've got an old demo disk that I need to view. It was made using RIX Softworks.  
The files on the two diskette set end with: .scf

The demo was VGA resolution (256 colors), but I don't know the spatial  
resolution.

First problem: When I try to run the demo, the screen has two black bars that  
cut across (horizontally) the screen, in the top third and bottom third of the  
screen. The bars are about 1-inch wide. Other than this, the demo (the  
animation part) seems to be running fine.

Second problem: I can't find any graphics program that will open and display  
these files. I have a couple of image conversion programs, none mention .scf  
files.

The system I am using: 486clone, Diamond Speedstar 24, Sony monitor.

Any suggestions?

Thank You,
