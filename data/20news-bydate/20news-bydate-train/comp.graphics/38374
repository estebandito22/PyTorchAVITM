I used the information provided in the recent resource listings and
tried to ftp to:

ccu1.aukland.ac.nz [130.216.1.5]:  ftp/mac/architec - *VISION-3D facet

and received an 'unknown host' message.

mail to Paul D. Bourke (pdbourke@ccu1.aukland.ac.nz) bounces with basically
the same problem.

Where'd he go????
