I'm using "rayshade" on the u.w. computers here, and i'd like input
from other users, and perhaps swap some ideas.  I could post
uuencoded .gifs here, or .ray code, if anyone's interested.  I'm having
trouble coming up with colors that are metallic (i.e. brass, steel)
from the RGB values.

If you're on the u.w. machines, check out "~fineman/rle.files/*.rle" on 
stein.u.washington.edu for some of what i've got.
