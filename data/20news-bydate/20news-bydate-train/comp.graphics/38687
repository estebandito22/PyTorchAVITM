==============================================================================
Has anyone created any interesting animations using Dmorph
I seem to be unable to create anything that looks remotely
realistic although this is probably due to the crappy GIF's
at I am using (One of Captain Kirk and One of Spock), i'm a
bit of a 'Trekker'.  What are the best type of pictures to use.
thanks........
