Hi,
I've got a PACE MODEM , Series Four 2400s ( made in England by
PACE Micro Technology ) with a broken power supply .
So I'd like to know :

- the voltage and current values of the original 
  power supply PS1001.
- the pinout of the power supply connector.
- the pinout of the USER PORT and how to use it.

Many thanks in advance to all the people help me.
Please post the reply also to my e-mail..........
