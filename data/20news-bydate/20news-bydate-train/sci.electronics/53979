You are probably referring to the products of

The make some amazing IRLED's.  The really high-powered devices are arrays of
3, 6, or 9, LED's on a TO-66 header.  The 9-chip model puts out 6.5 Watts in
response to a 5 Amp, 10 uS. pulse at a .5% duty cycle.  I think  these are
designed as illuminators for IR vision systems.

I would also be interested in the application here.  I work with a Dance and
Technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot
wide stage from 50 feet away.
