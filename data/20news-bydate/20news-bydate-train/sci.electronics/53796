Hello net.  I have a 386sx motherboard with the Phoenix BIOS, an on-board
IDE controller port, and two on-board serial ports.  Unfortunately, I don't
have a manual for this beast and I would like to be able to disable the IDE
controller in order to use the MFM controller I have.
The board says it is made in Korea and it uses the Chips Chipset.  If
anyone can give me a clue as to how to go about configuring the board so as
not to use the IDE controller, or how to go about finding out how to do it,
their help would be greatly appreciated.  
	Thank you in advance for your assistance.
Please mail buhrow@nfbcal.org with your responses as my news feed is rather
tenuous.
Thank you very much!
