I had a catalog with membrane keypads, but I dunno what
happened to it, and it was so long ago that I forget the
name of the company.  Anyway, you could make your own
legend and slip it behind the bezel.  Really nice and 
reasonably priced.  Can anyone tell me where to get some
more of these critters?  I've tried several places, but
none of them seem to have keypads which allow you to use
your own legend.

Any suggestion would be appreciated.
