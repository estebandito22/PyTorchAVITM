->I am looking for sizes smaller than #60, #65 or #70 would be good.

-best deal i ever saw on carbides was at ELI electronics - Cambridge
-Mass. Quite close to MIT, #70 drills @ $5.00 for a box of 50. ELI are
-in the Boston fone book.

Actually, I think they are all #57.  Their phone number is 617 547 5005
and I will probably have some over at the MIT Flea this Sunday.
