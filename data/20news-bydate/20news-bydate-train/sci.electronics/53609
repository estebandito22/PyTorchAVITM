This is vague, so I am posting it in case anyone else knows more.

I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification.
Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the
pickup.  The result was noisy and distinctly lo-fi, but much louder
than a conventional phonograph.  It tended to wear the disks out
pretty quickly though.
