Write a good manual to go with the software.  The hassle of
photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing
the package for only $15.  Also, consider offering an inexpensive
but attractive perc for registered users.  For instance, a coffee
mug.  You could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of
dollars, so consider pricing the product at $17.95.

You're lucky if only 20% of the instances of your program in use
are non-licensed users.

The best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into
your price structure.  Sure it hurts legitimate users, but too bad.
Retailers have to charge off loss to shoplifters onto paying
customers; the software industry is the same.

Unless your product is exceptionally unique, using an ostensibly
copy-proof disk will just send your customers to the competetion.
