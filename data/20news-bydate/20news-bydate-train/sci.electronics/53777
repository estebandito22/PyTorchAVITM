I repair a lot of monitors here, and I'd like to know where I can get a
pattern generator (or a circuit for one) that will provide MDA, EGA and VGA
signals. Using a whole PC to do this takes up too much space on my bench, and
is somewhat less than portable. I guess I could sit down and design something,
but I don't have the time right now - any (reasonable) suggestions would be
appreciated.
