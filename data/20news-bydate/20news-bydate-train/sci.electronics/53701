        On an A/D board I've got, I'm using the A/D lines.  It measures 
the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with 
5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish 
to lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great 
that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch 
the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor 
only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable. 
 
                What could the problems be and what else could I use
to lower the input voltage?  (btw I've got it grounded correctly)
