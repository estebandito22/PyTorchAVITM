I want to convert a 500 Volt sinewave with frequency between 1 kHz
and 10 kHz, to a 10 Volt sinewave with the same frequency, by
means of a transformer. The secondary current will be .6 A (600 mA).

What kind of transformer should I use (ferrite?)
Can I buy one? If so, I need a partnumber and supplier
If I cannot buy one, how do I go about winding one myself?
What core do I use, how big must it be in order not to saturate,
what thickness copper wire, how many turns, etc.?

I know little about analog electronics, so I hope some kind
soul here will help me out.
Pointers to relevant databooks will also be highly appreciated.

Thanks,
