My very favorite ad for such a device is on the back of the latest
Damark catalog.  Quoting from memory:

[Big flashy type]
"Dual deck VCR copies any tape -- Even those that are copy protected!*"

(And underneath the ad in very small print: *This device is not intended
for making illegal copies of copyrighted material.)
