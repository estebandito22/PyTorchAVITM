They are one of the largest manufacturers of IC packaging in the
world.

It sounds like you would be a good candidate for wafer probing or at
least IC probing to test performance.  HP, Cascade Microtech and
Tektronix should be able to help you here.  One note, testing at high
frequency accurately can be an *expensive* business.
