I recently bought an apparantly complete Expansion Chassis by Mountain
Computer Inc.  It consists of a box with 8 Apple ][+ compatible slots,
powersupply brick, interface card and ribbon cable to attach it to the computer
to be expanded.  There was also included a small card with empty sockets on top
and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the ][+ motherboard
somewhere after pulling a chip.  There's an empty socket also on the interface
card and a short 16-pin DIP jumper like the ones used with ][+ language cards.
 
This technological marvel came with no docs and I haven't a clue as how to hook
this thing up.  If anyone has docs and/or users disk of any sort for this I
could really use copies of them or at least some help.
 
I need to know:
 
o How to orient the ribbon cable between the card and the chassis.
o How to attach the short cable from the motherboard to the card
  and if the small card is used.
o The purposes of the various jumper-pins on the card (it has more
  of those than my CMS SCSI card!)
