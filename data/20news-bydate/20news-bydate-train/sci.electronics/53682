2SC1096
  Maximum Ratings:
    VCBO = 40V
    VCEO = 30V
    IC   = 3A
    PC   = 10W (T=25C)

  ICBO max = 1uA
  VCB = 30V
  COB = 55pF

  at Q-point VCE=5, IC=1A --> hfe = 100

2SA634
  Maximum Ratings:
    VCBO = -40V
    VCEO = -30V
    IC   = -3A
    PC   = 10W (T=25C)

  ICBO max = -1uA
  VCB = -30V
  COB = 75pF

  at Q-point VCE = -5V, IC = -1A --> hfe = 100

That's all i can get from my data book, hope that helps.
