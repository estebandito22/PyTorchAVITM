          and of course you older folks on the net will remember 
          way back when Adcom got its RAVE reviews and kudos (ca 
          1985  or  so)  their  555 amp and preamp WERE not only 
          designed here but built here in  the  USA.  then  they 
          went  to  mexico  and then to taiwan right after their 
          sales  skyrocketed   because   of   their   Stereopile 
          review!!!  if you have units that old look for MADE IN 
          --- stickers on your unit.
