Hi.  I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology
paper, and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the
TV screen at 1/200ths of a second.  Is that possible?  I thought the
maximum rate the TV was even capable of displaying images was 1/30th
of a second.  (or 1/60th of a second for an image composed of only odd
or even scan lines)
