I want to start a DSP project that can maniplate music in a stereo cassette. 
Is that any chip set, development kit and/or compiler that 
can equilize/mix music?  Ideally, The system should have D/A A/D converters &
a DSP compiler.  A rough estimate of the cost is greately appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
