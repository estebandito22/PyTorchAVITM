They are illegal here in Manitoba as well though I don't know what 
methods are used to detect them.

It has always amazed me with the way the laws work.  It is not illegal to 
sell them here in Manitoba, only to have them within a vehicle.  (Last I 
heard, they don't have to be installed to be illegal.)
