  Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators I've been seeing
all over late-night TV recently? I was wondering if they use forced air, heat,
or both. If there's heat involved, anybody know what temperature they run at?
My wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay >$100.00 for a box, a fan
and a heater. Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together
for just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?
