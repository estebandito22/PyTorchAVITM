What's the latest and greatest way to dim incandescent lamps ?

March '93 Circuit Cellar has part one of an article about
dimming 120VAC lamps, but it seems to lead into phase-
control as the best method for controlling brightness.
  I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzing
filaments and non-linear adjustment range. I had
heard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by
cycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp's
power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC, then
nothing for another 20 cycles. I wonder if anyone has
tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using. Any
advice is appreciated!

Ken
