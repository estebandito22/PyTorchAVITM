	Where can I buy or build a device that will convert 20 ma
current loop signals to RS232 voltages?  I know some old terminals
came with that option, but none of the ones I own have that.  Anyway,
I want to connect a computer to this old industrial computer to use
the computer with communications software as a console instead of
an old DecWriter.  Please e-mail me if you have any info that would
point me in the right direction.
