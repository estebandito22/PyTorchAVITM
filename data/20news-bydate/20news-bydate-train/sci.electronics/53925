Can anybody recommend a good, application-oriented beginner's reference
to RF circuits?  

I am pretty good on theory & know what different types of modulation mean, 
but don't have a lot of practical experience.  A book detailing working
circuits of different types (modulation, power, frequency, what is legal,
what is not, et cetera), would be very helpful.

Thanks.
