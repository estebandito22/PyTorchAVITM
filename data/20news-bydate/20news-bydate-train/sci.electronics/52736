I'm still not sure how this is supposed to work, since the .ZIP files
took up about 2.5Mb, so it must be a tight squeeze on those floppies...

However, I managed to install PADS and I'm pretty impressed.  I created
a couple of schematics without problem, but whenever I try to 
create a PCB layout from one of *my* circuits (rather than the demos)
it doesn't work.  I'm wondering if maybe a file isn't where it should
be...

Can anyone who has a printed manual comment on whether the registration
fee is worth paying?
