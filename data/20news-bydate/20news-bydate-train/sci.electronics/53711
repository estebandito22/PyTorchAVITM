The switches have a non-negligable on resistance (up to 1k ohm when
powered by 5 volts) and a maximum current and a Maximum Static
Voltage Across Switch.  Not a good bet for TTL.  Should work for
CMOS, but slow things down a bit.  There are 74HC versions that
have better specs. but lower max voltage.
