This was the Pathe you are thinking of, although there were other imitators.
It didn't wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs, but
it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air.
There are a lot of them still operating, and they are pretty ingenious.

There was a pneumatic amplifier designed by Alexander Graham Bell, as well,
but I don't know if it was ever constructed.
