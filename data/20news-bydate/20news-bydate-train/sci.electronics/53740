I have a MOSFET pulled out of a Trygon power supply, for which I have no 
manual.  It's a Motorola part with a 1972 date code and the number

		285-4

which the Motorola folks assure me is a house number, which they can't
help me with.  Any suggestions from folks out there?  I can't put it on
a curve tracer to try to get an equivalent, since it's completely shot.
