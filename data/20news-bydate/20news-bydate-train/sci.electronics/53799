Could someone please tell me if a 1/4 decoder is the same as a 1 to 4
demultiplexer. I know how to link 2 of these to get an 8 output circuit,
but how do I link 5 of these to make a 1/16 multiplexer. Sorry if this
seems like a lame question, but I'm only a newbie to electronics, and I
have to do this circuit. Please make any mail as droolproof as possible.

				 Thanx,
