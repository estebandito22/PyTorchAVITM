From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive
device much like the radio in your car.  They work as an antenna picking
up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  Therefore there would
be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of
detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.
