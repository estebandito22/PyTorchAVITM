I need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to
deliver ~6 joules at 250 volts. This implies a 200uf cap. I have built
a very satisfactorily operating version from a MAX641, but do not like
the idea of using a $6 single source part. It seems that the ubiquitous
camera flash circuit is what I want, but I cant get mine apart without
breaking it. I would appreciate receiving the circuit description or
a source of one. I have already looked in several electronics circuits
handbooks to no avail. Thanx
