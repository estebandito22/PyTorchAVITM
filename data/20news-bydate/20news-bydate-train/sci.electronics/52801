There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two
years--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials.

When a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the
National MM-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc.,
it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced
for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). Now, if you
have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead
gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know
the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.

The old GE thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on
SCR and triac applications that are not found elsewhere, for
example.
