I have a HP 1740 scope that (I think) has a problem in the HV section.
Symptom: started turning on and off on its own, making intermittant
bright flashes on the CRT, and then finally, passed away.  If you
have a manual (or any suggestions), please send me mail.  Will gladly
pay reproduction/shipping costs plus a little $ for your efforts for
the manual.  Thanks in advance.
