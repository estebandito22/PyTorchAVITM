	I've got an rgb Mistubishi monitor and on the back it has 5
BNC connectors labeled like this:

    composite
  HD          VD
  +           +        +       +       +
             sync     red    green    blue

	I've used it as a straight RGB monsitor but i can't figure out
how to use it for composite.  Could someone explain what these markings
mean?  Thanks for any help.

	tom
