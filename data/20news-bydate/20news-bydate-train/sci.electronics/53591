Hi,
	I am looking for some help in choosing a package
for a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently being 
fabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to test
the chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100
packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed
testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.
 	
	I know for sure that a DIP will not work
(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).
Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so
I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a
leadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard
to test since it has to be soldered on to the test
setup and I would spend loads of time soldering 
as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip
carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may
not work at high speeds.
 
	Does anyone out there have experience/knowledge
of this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/
names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages
would help. 
 
P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit
of overkill(?)
