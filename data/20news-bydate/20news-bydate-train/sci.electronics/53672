How hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular 
Motorola microcontrollers.  I am a novice at microcontrollers, but I am
starting to get into them for some of my projects.  I have several 256k
SIMMs laying around from upgraded Macs and if I could use them as "free"
memory in one or two of my projects that would be great.  One project that
comes to mind is a Caller ID device that would require quite a bit of RAM
to store several hundered CID records etc...
