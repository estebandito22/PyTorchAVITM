Yes, I know it sounds crazy. Call it an urge. Call it what you want.
Just don't ask why :-)

Anyway, I'd like to build a UV flashlight, cheaply. "flashlight" means
it should be reasonably portable, but could have a power pack if
necessary.

My main question is the bulb: where can I get UV bulbs? Do they
need a lot of power? etc., etc.

I'm not too concerned with whether it's long-wave or short-wave
(but hey, if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs, I'll take both).

One other thing: a friend of mine mentioned something about near-UV
light being cheaper to get at than actual UV light. Does anyone
know what he was referring to?

Thanks much.
