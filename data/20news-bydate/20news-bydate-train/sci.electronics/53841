Subject: PADS Question - How do I go from a schematic -> PCB?
Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana
Lines: 17

After I have produced a schematic with PADS-LOGIC, how do I import it into 
PADS-PCB to create a PCB pattern?  The only way I've gotten it to work is
to output a FutureNet netlist, and then import this into PADS-PCB.  Is there
another way of doing this?  I didn't see any information in the instructions
provided, but I might have missed something.  Any suggestions would be 
greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
