Has anybody out there used/tested these new Fluke Scopemeters?
How do they compare to a low-end Tectronix oscilloscope? Are
there any big drawbacks about these handheld scopes when
compared to the benchtop scopes of the same price range
($1000-$2000)?

Any info on the Fluke Scopemeters would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
