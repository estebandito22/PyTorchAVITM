I've recently picked up some TIL311 display chips, but I can't find
any information on them.  It seems they are no longer made by TI, and
I don't have an old enough data book.  :-(

It appears to have a dot-matrix led display capable of showing one hex
digit.  It is in a 14 pin DIP package, but pins 6, 9, and 11 are not
present.

If you have any information on this part (pinout, power requirments,
functions, ...) please send me e-mail.

Thank You,
