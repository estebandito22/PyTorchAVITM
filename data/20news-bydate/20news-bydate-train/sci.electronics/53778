Can anyone please email a diagram or give me details of an ftp site where there
is a diagram of a simple, small fm mono voice transmitter for trasnmitting in
the 90-104 range (preferably above 100 Mhz). Only a short distance requiered,
and frequency variation no too important but must run from 9v or smaller DC
supply.

Thanx in advance

Monty.
