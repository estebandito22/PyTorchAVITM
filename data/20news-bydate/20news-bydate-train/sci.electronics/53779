Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp
out level signals?  Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big
clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact
bounce?  How are you driving the relays?  TTL gate output?  Switching
transistor?  How are the relays connected to what you are driving?

Need more specifics to answer your question!! :-)
