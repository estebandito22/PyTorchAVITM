Good point...also, I wouldn't be surprised that the components
they use off-shore are of inferior quality.  As long as it was
properly designed and robust, premium components are used, it
shouldn't matter where it is assembled.

An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound.
The amp you have probably is running Class-A the whole day.

Actually, I'd be wary of excessively hot amps, 'cauz even though
the components inside may be rated to run that way, excessive 
heat will dramatically shorten the life of *any* electronic component
regardless of quality.  In fact, an amp that does run hot to the touch is
because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs!  Hmmmmm....
