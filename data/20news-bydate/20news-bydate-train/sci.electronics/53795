I was looking at the amps diagram for Sony 1090/2090 receivers, and I
was amazed to find a difference between the US and Canadian model
on the capacitor(s) that hangs off the output to the speakers:

                         ------\/\/\----- to speaker (identical both models
from amp ---------------|
(idnetical both models) >
                        <  10 
                        >
                        |
                       -----                        
                      |     |                        
        0.022        ---   ---        Canadian model only!
     US model        ---   --- 0.047 
     and world-wide   |     |
     model only.      |    ---        Candian model only!
                      |    ---  0.047
                      |     |
                       ----------- gound

The board itself is also identical, with room for all three caps. The
US/Can versions is clearly indicated in both places.

How does that make sense? 0.047/2 is 0.0235, essentially 0.022 for caps
(there are just standard caps, no special W/type/precision). 

Please explain this
