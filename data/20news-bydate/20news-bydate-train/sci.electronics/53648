MC>In the on-hook state you're not supposed to draw current.  

Ok lets have some calculation here: Going by Australian standards, which I 
presume might be similar to other countries ( If not, lets have some 
input) a phone uses 600ohm to loop a 48V line = 80mA. A standard LED 
drains 20mA. So what is the actual loop current required for an "off hook" 
indication, do you know?
