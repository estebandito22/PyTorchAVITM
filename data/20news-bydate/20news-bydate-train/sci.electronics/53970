I missed the first part of this thread; are you switching line level or
speaker level audio?
If line level, there's a single chip 4x1 *stereo* audio switch available
that switches 4 two-channel inputs into 1 two-channel output, and also
has a mute function, all controllable with ttl inputs.  LM1037, I think?

If speaker level, never mind.  :(
