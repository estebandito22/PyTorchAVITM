Hi there,
I have a mac 512 with a burned out part which looks like a voltage
regulator.  The part number is BU 406 and I believe the vender is
SGS thomas judging by teh SGS logo printed on the package.  If anyone
has teh spec for this part I would greatly appreciate an email with
the import info so I can find a replacement.  Thanx in advance.

BTW I don't need people telling me to throw the computer away.  If
  I had the money the thing would be in the trash in a second, but
  it does make a good terminal if nothing else.
