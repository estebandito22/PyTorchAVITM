On the other side of the fence, I owned a Bieffe off-road helmet.
Took what I would consider a minor fall, and had visible damage
to the shell.  Yes, the helmet did its job.  But the damage/impact
ratio was scary.  I own Bell Moto-5 now, have taken impacts on
order of twice the Bieffe impact (we do this frequently in MX),
and don't even have a scratch on it after two seasons.  My
recommendation is to buy _high_ quality gear.  YMMV.
