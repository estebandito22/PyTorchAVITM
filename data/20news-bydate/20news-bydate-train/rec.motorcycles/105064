I thought I posted this last year.

The women came to court with three witnesses; the two women that were in
the car and one neighbor that heard me shouting.  My lawyer didn't like
the odds since there were multiple complaints both ways and the judge had
a history of finding everyone guilty of at least something, so he convinced
us (she came without a lawyer) to drop everything.  The net result was
a $500 laywer bill for me and $35 court costs for her.

The only consolation was that she had trouble scraping together the $35
while $500 is not quite one week's beer money for me...
