Hola amigos,

Quiero... I need an answer to a pressing question.  I now own two
bikes and would love to keep them both.  One is a capable and
smooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great
brakes; the other is a Beemer G/S, kind of rough for the city but
great on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable, but
I don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately, insurance is going
to pluck me by the short hairs.  

Unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  They
do this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of 
driving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manage
to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (Turn left...
accelerate the Zephyr; turn right... accelerate the Beemer.)  Does
anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to
discount your rates?  State Farm doesn't.

By the way, I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes
there, and registering them.  To ease me of the shock, can somebody
guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson
they only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two,
per annum.

Muchas gracias,
			Enrique
