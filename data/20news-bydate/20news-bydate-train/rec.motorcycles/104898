What about the new Yamaha "Cyclelok" ?
From the photo in Motorcyclist, it looks the same hardened steel as a 
Kryptonite U lock, except it folds in five places.
It seems to extend out far enough to lock the rear tire to the tube of
a parking sign or similar.

Anyone had any experience with them, how easy is it to attack the lock
at the jointed sections ?
