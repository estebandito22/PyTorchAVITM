Subject: 1988 BMW K75S For Sale
Organization: Manes and Associates, NYC
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]
Lines: 10

3500 miles, black leather tank bra, tank bag, Corbin seat, Metzler 'B'
tires.  Garaged and pampered.  I can't afford to continue paying NYC garage
fees for two bikes so one of 'em has to go.

Best offer above $4500 takes it.
