Well it still looks like you've got an attitude problem
Mr. Muttonhead.  You should take the comments with more
sensitivity.  I still despise most people who belittle
drinking and driving since my first girlfriend was killed 
by such an asshole back in '85.  Learn to take the verbal 
abuse.

If you can't take the flames, 
and you can't use your brains,
stay out of the newsgroup.
