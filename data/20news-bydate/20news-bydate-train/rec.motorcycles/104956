So, I begin my 6 week sabbatical in about 15 minutes.  Six wonderful weeks
of riding, and no phones or email.

I won't have any way to check mail (or setup a vacation agent, no sh*t!), 
though I can dial in and get newsfeed, (dont ask), so if there are any 
outstanding CFC's or such things,please try my compuserve address:

72517.3356@compuserve.com

Anybody wants to do some WEEKDAY rides around the BA, send me a mail
to above or post here.

I'll be thinking about all of you stuck if front of your
terminals......"Sheeyaahhh, and monkeys might fly out of my butt..."
ride safe,
dave
