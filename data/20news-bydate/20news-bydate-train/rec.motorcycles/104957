Same thing to me.  Everyday the same dog would chase my bicycle.
The owners thought it was cute.  Even after I got the moto,
the stupid dog would do the same thing.  Then one day, I was
coming home in the opposite lane...the fluff with teeth ran to
get me and played momentum sharing with a 73 Dodge pick.
The owners tried to blame me for driving down street when I did.
I lived in a wierd town.
