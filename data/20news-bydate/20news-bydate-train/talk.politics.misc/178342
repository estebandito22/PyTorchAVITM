In the case of victimless crimes yes, I think so.

Think about it.  If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very
clear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral.  On the
other hand, if I smoke grass or have sex with a consenting adult in a
manner illegal in that state, the morality or immorality of that act is
merely a lifestyle choice; it doesn;t clearly hurt anyone else.  IMO, if
such an act doesn;t hurt another person it should not be interfered with.

I think so.  And I don't use drugs, outside of the legal ones (alcohol
and coffee).
