Which, considering the amount Bush&congress added to it, would be a
not-inconsiderable achievement.

While we're on the subject, I also believe that the supply-side claim that
reducing taxes raised revenue is also false, because they typically factor in
SocSec taxes, which were *raised* a considerable amount, at the same time that
income taxes were cut.  If you look at income tax revenue alone, it fell after
after the cuts began, and didn't recover for several years. By then, record
deficits were well entrenched.
