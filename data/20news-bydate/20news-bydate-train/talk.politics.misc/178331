	I have come to the conclusion that the TV stations here in LA
	WANT a riot to happen when the verdict comes in.

	In a not so subtle way they are preparing their audience for the
	worst and even going so far as to want SOMETHING to happen for
	their viewers with all their commercials and their "we are ready
	for anything so watch US" messages...
