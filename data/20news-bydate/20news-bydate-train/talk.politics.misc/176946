# #You are incorrect.  The most recent survey data I can find shows that
# #26% of molestation is exclusively homosexuals, 4% is bisexual (victims

#     So what you are saying is that 74% of the child molestations are

Bisexuals are heterosexuals?  Since when?

#   which concludes that by being homosexual, you will molest children or that
#   by being homosexual you will have the propensity for molesting children.

I haven't said that "homosexual = child molester," simply that is more
likely.

#   If 26% of the molestations are by homosexuals, why are you so concerned
#   about creating a relation between the two? If you had evidence that 
#   95% of the molestations are committed by homosexuals you might find a 
#   relationship. Ok, where is the realtionship you make?        

The one that is shown when NAMBLA marches in gay parades.

#     Also, what is the reason people molest? From Human Sexuality and a 
#   psych class or too I have taken the overwhelming voice says that people
#   commit these acts as power trips and to feel in control. This has nothing
#   to do with sexual orientation. 

You mean that S&M, because it's a power trip, has nothing to do with
sexual orientation?
