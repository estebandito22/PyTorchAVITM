Ahhh, the classic Truth By Blatant Assertion technique.  Too bad it's
so demonstrably false.  Take a look at Great Britain sometime for a 
nice history on drug criminalization.  The evidence there shows that
during periods of time when drugs (such as heroin) were illegal, crime
went up and people did die from bad drugs.  During times when drugs
were legalized, those trends were reversed.

Now this is a great example of an ironclad proof.  Gosh, I'm convinced.
( :-} for the humor impaired).  First, assert something for which you
have no evidence, then dodge requests for proof by claiming to know
what this group was intended for.  As to research, if you'd done any
at all, you'd realize that there is plenty of reason to believe that
legalizing drugs will have many benefits to society.  There are some
plausible arguments against it, too, but they aren't enough to convince
me that criminalization of drugs is the answer.  I'm willing to be
convinced I'm wrong, but I seriously doubt the likes of you can do it.
