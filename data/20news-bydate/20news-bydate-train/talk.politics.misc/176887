Last night I heard something about Bill Clinton's sister being
involved in a marijuana bust, and the news being suppressed. I also
heard something about her being an "ex-con". This source is not
reliable, though. (It was a collage/booklet advertising a local band.)

Can anyone on the net verify this or provide more details? I'm
surprised I haven't seen anything about this in this newsgroup.

Also, does anyone know what happened to the charges that Shalala was a
regular pot smoker when she was in college? This ghastly accusation
was reported on CNN Streamline News the day she was nominated, then I
never heard anything about it again.

It's almost enough to make me want to start an Act-Up type campaign
to invade the privacy of closet smokers! (If only this type of
publicity didn't violate people's rights. . . .)

Jake.
