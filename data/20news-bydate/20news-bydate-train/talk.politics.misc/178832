Isn't is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality 
uses a very flawed (IMHO) source of information to pass jusgement on all 
homosexual and bisexual men.  It would seem more logical to say that since 
the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity 
larger as well.  In my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it.

Men are men and they all like sex.  I am a gay male.  I have had sex three 
times in my life, all with the same man.  Before that, I was a virgin.

So... whose promiscuous?

Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals.  Just because 
someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do.  Look at the world....  
Statistics alone prove that most criminals are by default hetero...

Look closely at the person, not the group.

All flames will be ignored.  :)
