That was hardly the point, was it? I was commenting on this all-too-common
Republican attitude that if people disagree with us, they must be idiots, they
must be sheep being led around by the Evil Liberal Media Conspiracy. This is
a dangerous attitude indeed. Because it's not a very big step from "people
are sheep, they can't think for themselves" to "people are sheep and need
firm leadership from we, who know better"... this sort of attitude makes
me worry about what'll happen to the United States if the extremist wing
of the Republican party ever gets back into power again.

Hey! This is a government-funded newsgroup! Let's have some separation
of church and state, damn it!

More like:

Broward: "Clinton's going to raise your income taxes by over $1000!"
Mark:    "No, he's not, only about $204."
Broward: (silence)

OK, I predict that in 1996 the Republicans will STILL be bitter. Yeah, yeah,
I know, it's not very impressive to predict things that are inevitable...
