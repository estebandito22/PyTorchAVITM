	If you look through this newsgroup, you should be 
	able to find Clinton's proposed "Wiretapping" Initiative
	for our computer networks and telephone systems.

	This 'initiative" has been up before Congress for at least
	the past 6 months, in the guise of the "FBI Wiretapping"
	bill.

	I strongly urge you to begin considering your future.

	I strongly urge you to get your application for a passport
	in the mail soon.

	I strongly urge you to consider moving any savings you 
	have overseas, into protected bank accounts, while 
	you are still able.
