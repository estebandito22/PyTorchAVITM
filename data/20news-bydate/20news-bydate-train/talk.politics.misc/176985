it may be a little late to reply to your tirade and also on an inaapropriate
board but along with all of the so called great things the white male has done they have also contributed to society by means of mass genocide, the theft of
ideas and cultures, creating and the perptration of historical lies throughouttime among many other horrible activities.
but every culture has its upside and its downside.  it seems to me that the 
white male (must be extremely ignorant to qualify for the following - if
you're not disregard) and western culture are the only things that look to 
actively classify things as good or bad, worthy or unworthy (ya dig)
it can be seen with slavery and the manipulation and destruction of the 
american indians civilization.  nothing but selfish acts that benefit one 
group of people (and not even their women get or got respected or regarded as
equal - ain't that some stuff)

white men - not being specific - but in a lot of cases are just wack or have
wack conceptions of how the world is to serve their purpose.  

just look at david koresh - throughout history (i may be shortsighted on this one so excuse my predjudiced ignorance) only white men associate themselves withbeing GOD.  no other culture is ignorant or arrogant enough to assume such a 
position.  and then to manipulate and mislead all those people.

hmmm...  i'd say look in your history books but since it seems that history 
has been written to glorify the exploits of white men you'd only find lies.

awww that's enough already from me because this has nothing to do with sex or this board.  if ya'd like to continue this discussion e-mail me and we can 
compare and contrast ideas

			i like conflict - it's educational when the 
			communcation is good......................

my $.02 worth

(i apologize to those who thought this was going to be about SEX but i was
prompted by a response i found up here)
