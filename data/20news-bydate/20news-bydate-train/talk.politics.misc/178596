OK.  I stand corrected.  I guess, then, that the comments about payoffs
(i.e., "pork") to Puerto Ricans that others have been making still
stands?

Now, everybody, how about some opinion on the following related topic:

Should the people who are natives of U.S. territories have
representation in the U.S. House of Rep's or the U.S. Congress?
The U.S. Constitution sets up the House of Representatives to represent
each State in proportion to its population, and the Senate to represent
each State equally.  What should be done with U.S. territories like
Puerto Rico?  Does anyone have knowledge about how this was handled in
the past, such as with the Louisiana Territory or the Northwest
Territory?

Chris
