If the heading is true, Mr. Frank should be ashamed of himself.

Nothing makes me gag more than people who don't respect the
rights of others to voice their opinions.  My idol Lenny Bruce
once commented about "that asshole Time Magazine" when they
advocated censorship of his material.  Time actually sided
with the cops' and their arresting of Bruce at his shows,
whereby he routinely would say "cocksucker", then the cops
would rush the stage to arrest him.  My, how the times haven't
changed...

I can't help but think of how Lenny would be received in today's
politically correct arena.  Heck, I even support the right of
neo nazis to speak their opinions and march down the streets.

And before Mr. Frank or anyone else makes any wisecracks about
anti-Semitism...I'm Jewish, a longtime member of AIPAC and the JNF,
and have contributed over $1000 apiece to these fine groups.  I'm
a regular contributor to every pro-Israel group I can find, but I
still support the right of people like Arf to speak up and vomit
his propaganda.

I want to know just WHO these people are !!!

I'm basing all this on the assumption that Mr. Frank did indeed
write to some sysadmin requesting Mr. Teel to be admonished.  If
this is not the case, I hereby retract these nasties directed
toward him.  If not, I stand against Mr. Frank and his trashing
of the First Amendment.
