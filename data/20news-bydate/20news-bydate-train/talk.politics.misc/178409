Reasonable doubt dates back to Human Rights. We are now in the time of
Civil Rights. Civil Rights are issued by the State with whatever strings
attached they choose as the Grantor of said rights. And if that means that 
verdicts are determined by the needs of the state rather than by guilt or 
innocence in a traditional sense, so be it. Being subjective rather than 
objective may make it harder to anticipate what is right, and you may be 
sacrificed for being wrong inadvertantly once in a while, but that really is a 
small price to pay for the common good don't you think?
