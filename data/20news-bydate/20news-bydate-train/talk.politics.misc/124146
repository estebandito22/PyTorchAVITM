Yes, very serious.  I claim that I can substantiate my statement that
Rudman says he doesn't believe Perot was investigating him.  You claim
Perot was investigating him.  If you will state that you were in error
on this point, provided I produce the source, I'll go dig it up.

Now give me one reason why I should go to the trouble if you won't
agree to this?  It is simple enough you know.  But I don't have time
to waste if you'll just blow it off with more of the tripe you usually
post.
