You think that you all have it bad....here at good ol' Southwest Missouri
State U., we have 2 parties running for student body president.  There's the
token sorority/fraternity faces, and then there's the president and vice
president of NORML.  They campaigned by handing out condoms and listing
their qualifications as,"I listen really well."  It makes me sick to have
a party established on many of the things that are ruining this country like
they are.  I think I'll run next year.:(
