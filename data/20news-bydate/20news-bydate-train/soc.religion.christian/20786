I'll pose a question here that's got me thinking:  what distinguishes
"true" religion from cults (I'm speaking generally here, not specifially
about Christianity)?  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on 
Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that
true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person.
But, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity
IS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes, for example, the
Branch Davidian "cult" from the Presbyterian "church"?  Doctrinal
differences don't answer the question, IMHO, so don't use them as
an answer.

[There have been some attempts to characterize "cult".  Most commonly
it uses characteristics involving high pressure, brainwashing
techniques, etc.  But some people characterize it by doctrinal
error.  In the end I'm afraid it becomes a term with no precise
meaning that's used primarily to dismiss groups as not worthy
of serious consideration.  That doesn't mean that there aren't
groups that do highly irresponsible things and have serious
doctrinal errors.  But past discussions have not suggested to me
that "cult" is a very helpful term.  --clh]
