Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me 
as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with
translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people
group he was serving.
WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture
in minority languages.

The sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this
along the lines of "ideological manipulation and cultural
interference" is probably no more than Christianising and
education - in this WBT will stand alongside the early Christian
missionaries to parts of Africa, or those groups who worked
among native Americans a couple hundred years ago.

I think you need to substantiate these attacks as being a
legitimate criticism of priorities other than spreading the
gospel among underdeveloped people.
