: I may be wrong, but wasn't Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath?  He's a
: MAJOR brother in Christ now.  He totally changed his life around, and
: he and his wife go on tours singing, witnessing, and spreading the
: gospel for Christ.  I may be wrong about Black Sabbath, but I know he
: was in a similar band if it wasn't that particular group...

   Yes, but Jeff also speaks out against listening to bands like Black
Sabbath. He says they're into all sorts of satanic stuff. I don't know.
