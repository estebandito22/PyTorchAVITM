I was wondering if anyone knew any changes to the temple
ceremony within the last fifty years....
Also, why do you think they were made (revelation, 
assimilation to mainstream Christianity, etc.)?
I know that the God Makers was published quite a while
ago.  Could rituals have been changed since then?

I am also very interested in the influence of Freemasonry
on early Mormonism, especially in the Smith family and 
in the Nauvoo settlement.  Info on any new studies would 
be appreciated.

Thanks,
