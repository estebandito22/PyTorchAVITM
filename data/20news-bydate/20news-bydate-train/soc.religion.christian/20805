Hi,
   I'd like to subscribe to Leadership Magazine but wonder if there is one on
disk instead of on paper. Having it on disk would save me retyping
illustrations, etc into a word processor. It's just cut and paste.
   If there are other good Christian magazines like Leadership on disk media,
I'd appreciate any info.

With gratitude,
James.
