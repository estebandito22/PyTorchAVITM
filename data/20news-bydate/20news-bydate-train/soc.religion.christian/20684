I am beginning an e-mail discussion group about cell churches.  If you are
a follower of Jesus Christ and are

  - in a cell church, or
  - in a church that is transitioning to a cell church, or
  - just interested in learning more about cell churches,

send me e-mail.  (I reserve the right to remove anybody from the group who
does not demonstrate a spirit of humility and Christlikeness.)
