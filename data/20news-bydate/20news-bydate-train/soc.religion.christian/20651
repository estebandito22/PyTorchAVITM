  o.k.  i don't follow god "blindly".  once, long ago, i questioned authority
to such a rabid point that i found question_authority=reject_authority_
_unquestioningly.  i question authority all the time.  but to forever
question is fruitless...eventually we have to consider whether there are
answers to the questions, whether the "authority" {say, the bible in this
case} has validity.  basically to question authority does not necessarily
mean reject authority.
