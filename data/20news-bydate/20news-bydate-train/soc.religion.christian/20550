Adam, I just finished a study on this, not only looking at the
prophecies themselves, but where they were fulfilled.  While going only
through the OT, I found 508 references.  After starting to show their
fulfillment, I found out that I had missed some, so needless to say I
cannot post them here.  However, the study I did I intend to publish (I
am in the process of organizing and showing the fulfillments, then I
will be ready to write and send it to a publisher).  With any luck
(and/or free time) I should have it finally done sometime around
September (I hope).
