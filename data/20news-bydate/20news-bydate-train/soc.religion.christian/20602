Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure
from punishing people?  The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and
his angels.

To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with
the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the Bible
teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.  Their
judgement is soon to come.

Let me suggest this.  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory
should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.  Stay away
from human theories, and only take into account references in the bible.
