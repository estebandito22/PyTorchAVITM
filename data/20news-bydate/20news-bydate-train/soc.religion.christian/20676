I am curious if anyone in net-land has spent any time at any of the L'Abri
houses throughout the world and what the experience was like, how it affected
you, etc.  Especially interesting would be experiences at the original L'Abri
in Switzerland and personal interactions with Francis and/or Edith Schaeffer.
