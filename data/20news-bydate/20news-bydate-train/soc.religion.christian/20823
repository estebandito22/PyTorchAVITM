A section of Richard Badenas' book, "Christ The End of the Law, Romans 10.14 
in Pauline Perspective."  The section I have is on the Contextual setting and 
meaning of Romans 9-11.  In addition, there are 111 endnotes.

Since the file is so long, and because of other reasons, I will take requests
for the article personally.

Of course, I believe Badenas' insights to be true, and, quite damaging to the
traditional Augustinian/Calvinist view.
