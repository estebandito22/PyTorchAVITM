There is some controversy in my denomination as to what authority is vested 
in the pastor.  I am still forming my opinion.  I am solicing opinions, and 
references for what that is, how much, and how it should be used.

   As a general reference, I would not exclude responses from different 
denominations based on Biblical teachings, but you have to understand our 
church is independent, protestant and likely to be much different from those 
that follow ecclesiastical authority in the church.  We may need to discuss 
the roles of deacons and elders.

Thanks for your replies.
