Hey...

I may be wrong, but wasn't Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath?  He's a
MAJOR brother in Christ now.  He totally changed his life around, and
he and his wife go on tours singing, witnessing, and spreading the
gospel for Christ.  I may be wrong about Black Sabbath, but I know he
was in a similar band if it wasn't that particular group...

HOW GREAT IS TH LOVE THE FATHER HAS LAVISHED ON US, THAT WE SHOULD BE
CALLED CHILDREN OF GOD!  AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE!  (1 JOHN 3:1)

Grace and peace to all, (I'll see you ALL Someday!)
