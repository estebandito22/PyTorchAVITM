There was a recent discussion of Dungeons and Dragons and other role
playing games.  Since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and
science fiction and fantasy fans, I will mention that I am the editor
and publisher of RADIO FREE THULCANRA, a Christian-oriented science
fiction fanzine.  It is not a Christian magazine with a special
interest in science fiction.  It is a science fiction fanzine with a
special interest in Christianity.  Gaming is not a major topic of
discussion but it has come up in some letters.  (No, there are no
arguments about whether D&D is satanic.  People who think it is are
not likely to be reading RFT.)  Anyway, I am now working on the April
issue.  I will send a sample copy to any reader of
soc.religion.christian who requests it.  It is printed on paper, so
requests should include a snail-mail address.
