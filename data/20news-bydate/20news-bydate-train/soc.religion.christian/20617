Years ago I grabbed the following from the net - maybe from this
newsgroup.  Does anyone know of a source for whether this is an
accurate quote?   Thanks!  Bartletts leaves out the homosexual lines,
but they were one of the groups the Nazis tried to exterminate.
===
In Germany, they first came for the communists,
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a communist.
Then they came for the jews,
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a jew.
Then they came for the trade unionists,
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist.
Then they came for the homosexuals, and I didn't speak up
because I wasn't a homosexual.
Then they came for the catholics, and I didn't speak up
because I was a protestant.
Then they came for me ---
but by that time there was no one left to speak up.
