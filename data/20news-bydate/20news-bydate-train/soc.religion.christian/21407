Sorry!

What does the Coptic Church believe about the will and energy of Christ?
 Were there one or were there two (i.e. Human and Divine) wills and
energies in Him.

Also, what is the objection ot the Copts with the Pope of Rome (i.e. why
is there a Coptic Catholic Church)?  Do you reject the supreme
jurisdiction of the 263rd sucessor of St. Peter (who blessed St. John
Mark, Bishop of Alexandria was translator for) and his predecessors?  Or
his infallibility?  Or what other things perhaps?
