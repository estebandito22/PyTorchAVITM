   without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really
   beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three
   deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants
   in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.

I heard the Gregorian chant of the Passion on Good Friday.  In this
liturgy, our Lord is definitely *very* sad.  It's as if He has
resigned Himself to die for these poor pitiful creatures who are
killing Him.

The chant is *quite* beautiful.
