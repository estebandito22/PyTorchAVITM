Concerning Christians praying for coporate forgiveness of national sins, 
Michael Covington claims the following of C.S. Lewis:

> C. S. Lewis made the same point in an essay after World War II,
> when some Christian leaders in Britain were urging "national repentance"
> for the horrors (sins???) of World War II.

I was surprised when I heard this same kind of remark from a fellow grad. 
student I know, especially since he had seminary training.  I have read the 
same essay and do not find Lewis making any such claim.  Rather, Lewis is 
condemning the use of such coporate prayer efforts as platforms to make 
political jabs at opponents, feigned as confessions of guilt (ie., Lord please 
forgive us for allowing "insert political issue/idea/platform" to exist in our
country, it is wrong and we ask your forgiveness.).  I would be interested in
knowing what part of the essay you feel condemns national repentance (please
quote).
