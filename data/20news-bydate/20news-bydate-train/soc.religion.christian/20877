I have stated before that I do not consider myself an atheist, but 
definitely do not believe in the christian god.  The recent discussion
about atheists and hell, combined with a post to another group (to the
effect of 'you will all go to hell') has me interested in the consensus 
as to how a god might judge men.  As a catholic, I was told that a jew,
buddhist, etc. might go to heaven, but obviously some people do not
believe this.  Even more see atheists and pagans (I assume I would be 
lumped into this category) to be hellbound.  I know you believe only
god can judge, and I do not ask you to, just for your opinions.

Thanks,
-Tim
