Coming from a long line of "hot tempered" people, I know temper when I see
it.  One of the tell tale signs/fruits that give non-christians away - is
when their net replies are acrid, angry and sarcastic.  

We in the net village do have a laugh or two when professed, born again
christians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won to
christianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were
"spiritually hungry."  Instead of answering questions with sweetness and
sincerity, these chrisitan net-warriors, "flame" the queries. 

You don't need any enemies.  You already do yourselves the greatest harm.

Again I say, foolish, foolish, foolish.
