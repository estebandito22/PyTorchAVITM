Hi!

	Anyone know anything about the Interdisciplinary Bible Research
Institute, operating out of Hatfield, Pa?

	I'm really interested in their theories on old-earth
(as opposed to young earth) and what they believe about evolution.

	Thanks,
		In the Master,

		Charley.

                      and enslavement.

is a dedicated group for that, talk.origins.  --clh]
