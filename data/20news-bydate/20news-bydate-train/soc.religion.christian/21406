If babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn't the Bible
ever say so.  It never comes right and says "Only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised."
        What Christ did say was :

        "I solemly assure you, NO ONE can enter God's kingdom without
         being born of water and Spirit ... Do not be surprised that I
         tell you you must ALL be begotten from above."

Could this be because everyone is born with original sin?
