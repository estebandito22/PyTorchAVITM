Sorry, but I think this interpretation of the Matthew 13 parables is
nonsense. I.e.,

> 'yeast' - *ALWAYS* stands for sin/corruption/heresy. For example 'beware

Matthew 16:12 explains that by "leaven of the Pharisees" Jesus was simply
referring to their teaching; not sin/corruption/heresy.

Jesus gaves His apostles the keys of the kingdom and said that
the gates of hell would not prevail against His church.
