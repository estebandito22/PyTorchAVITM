Hi, You might want to read Charismatic Chaos by John MacArthur.  In it
he discussed exactly this queation, amongst others.  In my own words,
VERY simplified, his position is basically that one must decide, what
is the most important - experience or Scripture?  People tend to say
Scripture, without living according to that.  Their own
feeling/prophecy/etc tends to be put across without testing in the
light of Scripture.

There's a lot more than this, really worthwhile to read whether you're
Charismatic or not.
