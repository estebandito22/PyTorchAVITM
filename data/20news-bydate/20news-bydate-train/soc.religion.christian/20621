There has been some talk recently of Latin rites from the early Church used to
bless same-sex unions.If anyone has any idea where copies of these rites
exist (in whole or in part), please notify me by e-mail.  (I understand that
similar ceremonies written in Slavonic exist as well.  Let me know where I can
find these.)  It doesn't matter whether the Latin rite is in the original or a
translation.  However, I would prefer to have an English version of the Slavon-
ic rite, if it exists.  Thanks in advance.

[We've had questions about this in the past.  The only source I know
of is claims by John Boswell in some talks.  He is said to be working
on publication, but as far as I know, nothing is published yet.  I
haven't heard of any other source.  If anyone knows of another source,
please tell us.  But I think we're going to have to wait for Boswell's
publication to appear in order to see what he's really talking about.
