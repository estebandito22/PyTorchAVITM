Hi I am a Sociology student and I am currently researching into 
young offenders.  I am looking at the way various groups of 
children are raised at home.  At the moment I am formlulating 
information on discipline within the Christian home.

Please, if you are a parent in this catagory can you email me 
your response to the following questionaire.  All responses 
will be treated confidentially and will only be used to prepare 
stats.

1.  Ages & sexes of children

2.  Do you spank your kids?

3.  If so how often?

4.  Do you use an implement to spank with? 


5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?

6.  Your age?

7.  Your location

8.  While under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal 
offence?

9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid


Thank you in advance for any reply you can make.  Please e-mail 
your replies rather than post them on the newsgroup

[I hope it is obvious that responses to this question are likely to
have serious problems when used for research purposes.  Our readers
are not likely to be a random sample of Christians, and this form does
not contain enough information to act as a stratified sample.  Perhaps
someone who is familiar with research methods might want to correspond
with him.  --clh]
