Some variant is quite popular.  This, and other arguments, are
discussed in John Leslie Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism: arguments
for and against the existence of God".  Although Mackie ultimately
sides with "against", his arguments are, I think, quite fair to both
sides.  Brief discussions can be found in the alt.atheism FAQs.
