Hi Christian friends,

My name is Joel, I have a sister who's 25th birthday is tomorrow.....She
used to be on fire for the Lord, but somehow, for some reason, she
became cold....she don't want to associate anymore with her old
christian friends.........so I thought maybe some of you could help her
out again by sending her a postcard or card with a little message of
encouragement.....hand written is okay....her address is 3150 Hobart
Ave. San Jose Ca. 95127...........

Thank you and God Bless.

PS: Jesus Christ is LORD!!!!!!!! 

[I have some qualms about postings like this.  You might want to
engage in a bit more conversation with Joel before deluging 
someone who doesn't expect it with cards.  --clh]
