I am a student at UW-Eau Claire.  I am doing a paper an witches and wanted to
get your point of view.  I will not use you name unless you specifically tell
me to do so.

Please answer this question:

As a Christian, are you offended by witches and Wiccan?  Do you feel that tehy
are pagan in the evil sense of the word?

You time and cooperation is appreciated.  Thanks, J.
