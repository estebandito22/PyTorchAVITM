           It's my understanding that the U.S. Supreme Court has never 
       given a legal definition of religion.  This despite the many 
       cases involving religion that have come before the Court. 
           Can anyone verify or falsify this?  
           Has any state or other government tried to give a legal 
       definition of religion?
