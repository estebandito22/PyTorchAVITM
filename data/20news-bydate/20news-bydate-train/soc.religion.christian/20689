We also cannot fail to note the intense suffering a devastation which has been
wrecked on our world because of Christians -- who were certain they were
following Christ.  From Captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict
obedience to the Gensis command to subdue the earth, to Nazi's who have
"justly"
punished the Jews for the killing Christ (as well as the other progroms), the
innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with "you shall not allow a
witch to live", the Moslems who were killed in the Crusades, the god-fearing
men destroyed by the inquistion.  The religious wars in Spain, France, England,
etc.  Christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss
of life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the
instructions therein, was unquestionable.  There is much to grieve.
