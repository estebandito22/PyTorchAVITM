In a short poem ("God in His mercy made / the fixed pains of Hell"),
C. S. Lewis expresses an idea that I'm sure was current among others,
but I haven't be able to find its source:

that even Hell is an expression of mercy, because God limits the amount
of separation from Him, and hence the amount of agony, that one can
achieve.
