On of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they
should not be spoken of in a "common manner" or "trampled under
feet" such as the Lords name is today.  The ceremonies are
performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside
as being as sacred/holy/uncommon place.  We believe that the 
ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they
are viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the
temple.  So from our point of view, when they are brought
out into the public, they are being trampled under feet,
because of misinterpretations and mocking, and it is therefore
offensive to us.

Please do not assume that because of my use of the words
'we' and 'our' that I'm an official spokesman for the LDS
church.  I am merely stating what I believe is the general
feeling among us.  Others feel free to disagree.
