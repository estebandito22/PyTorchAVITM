Walter-

I tried several times in the past to communicate with you and Susan, but
you ignored me, and I don't honestly believe my letters were mean.  Rather
I thought they were thoughtful and compassionate, but I see now what I should
have seen then.  Call me naive.

I give up on this group.  As my Lord advised, that if you are unwelcome in
a city then brush the dust of your feet and go on.

If anyone cares about the topic they write to me direct, if not, well,
may God bless you as well.

Bye to this group.
PAX
