Mr. Meritt, please state explicitly the inductive argument which leads
you to conclude Mr. Tice thinks it "OK" to take biblical quotes out of
context in some other t.r.m. articles.

Also, please explain why you rely on inductive reasoning (with its
implicit uncertainty) in determining Mr. Tice's opinions when the man
is himself clearly available for questioning.

Finally, please indicate whether you agree (yes or no) with the
following statement:

   The word "agree" and the phrase "not disagree" are identical in
   meaning.
