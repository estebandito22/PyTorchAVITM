No, I don't mean the LR, whatever that is.  As for which GD, I'm using _The
Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic_ as my source, so (unless Regardie is
lying) I'm pulling the name out the the original order's rituals.  The
multiple modern groups are part of why I through in the comment about all
the "spin-offs".

As a member of the Religious Society of Friends (my membership is in the
Urbana-Champaign (IL) Friends Meeting) I find that amusingly ironic. :)

be the TRUE whatever.  I find that disgusting. :(

Enjoy the journey!
