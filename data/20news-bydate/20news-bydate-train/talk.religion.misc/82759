   Not to be too snide about it, but I think this Christianity must
   be a very convenient religion, very maliable and suitable for
   any occassion since it seems one can take it any way one wants
   to go with it and follow whichever bits one pleases and
   reinterpret the bits that don't match with one's desires.  It
   is, in fact, so convenient that, were I capable of believing
   in a god, I might consider going for some brand of Christianity.
   The only difficulty left then, of course, is picking which sect
   to join.  There are just so many.

Yes, Christianity is convenient.  Following the teachings of Jesus
Christ and the Ten Commandments is convenient.  Trying to love in a
hateful world is convenient.  Turning the other cheek is convenient.  So
convenient that it is burdensome at times.

Dave.
