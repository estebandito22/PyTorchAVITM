Just a few cheap shots a Christianity:

Riddle: What is the shortest street in Jerusalem?
Answer: The Street of the Righteous Poles.

Limrick:

There was an archeologist Thostle
Who found an amazing fossil
By the way it was bent
And the knot it the end
'twas the penis of Paul the Apostle.

Jingle:
Christianity hits the spot
Twelve Apostles thats a lot
Jesus Christ and a Virgin too
Christianity's the faith for you
(with apologies to Pepsi Cola and its famous jingle)

Riddle:
How many Christians does it take to save a light bulb.
Answer: None, only Jesus can save.

Aphorism:
Jesus Saves
Moses Invests

Proof that Jesus was Jewish:
1. He lived at home till he was 33
2. He went into his fathers business
3. He thought he mother was a virgin
4. His mother thought he was God.

QED.

So long you all
