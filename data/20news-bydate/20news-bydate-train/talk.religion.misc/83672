In a previous article, cdcolvin@rahul.net (Christopher D. Colvin) says:

>I worked at AMORC when I was in HS.

OK: So you were a naive teen.

>He [HS Lewis] dates back to the 20's. 

	Wrong: 1915 and if you do your homework, 1909.
But he was born LAST century (1883).

>
>Right now AMORC is embroiled in some internal political turmoil. 

No it isn't.
