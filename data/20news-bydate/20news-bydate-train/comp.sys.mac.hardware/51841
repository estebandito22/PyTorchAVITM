I have  a strange piece of equipment to unload. It is a Ether+ SCSI interface.
Apparently, it can be plugged into a SCSI port and from there to an ethernet.
That way you save a slot. Nifty. Well, I assume you people know more about it,
so, judging by the $350 price tag new, I'll ask, say, $75? Anybody interested?
