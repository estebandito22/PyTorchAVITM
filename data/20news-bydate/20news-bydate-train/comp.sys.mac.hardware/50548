I would like to know what people's opinions are about the 
"real world" differences are between a C650 with and without 
a coprocessor...

I don't use anything like Mathamatica, Maple, etc. I don't use
Spreadsheets (at least no sheets with complicated anything), I
don't use 3D CAD apps (although I used to), 

I DO:  use 3D renderers, EXTENSIVE communications, I run a BBS,
I write software, I write papers, etc...

BTW, just for kicks, this is what I was told by my local Apple
Rep about upgrading a 68LC040 to a 69RC040 on a C650:
"Well, Apple built in an extra socket for the coprocessor chip.
 That way, you just plug in the coprocessor, and it works."
I then heartily laughed and hung up the phone.

thanks,

-nate
