Peter, I'm sure someone out there has a better/easier way to do what you want
to do, but I'll tell you how we do it where I work. We have about 15 Macs
networked together using Appletalk and PhoneNet connectors. To chat we use a
program called 'Broadcast'. With it we can send brief messages to all or
selected machines within the network.

Hope that helps...
