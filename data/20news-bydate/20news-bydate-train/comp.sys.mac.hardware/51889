Interestingly enough, the CDROM 300i that came with my Quadra 800 has 
only 8 disks:

1. System Install
2. Kodak Photo CD sampler
3. Alice to Ocean
4. CDROM Titles
5. Application Demos
6. Mozart: Dissonant Quartet
7. Nautilus
8. Apple Chronicles

Has anyone else noticed that they got less than everyone seems to be
getting with the external?  What I really feel I missed out on is what
is supposed to a fantastic Games demo disk.

I have heard that people have gotten up to 9-10 disks with their drive.
I assume they get the 8 titles above plus Cinderella and the Games Demo CDROM.

any comments and experiences?  Should I call Apple to complain? =)
