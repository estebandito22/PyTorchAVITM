Well Bill, There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM
expansion slot giving you 4MB. The only thing you can do to upgrade to
the maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion,
giving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170....You can try calling
TechWorks, or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek, MacWorld...etc....
