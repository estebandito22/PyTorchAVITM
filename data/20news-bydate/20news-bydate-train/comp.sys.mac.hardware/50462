The screws are Torx screws and the tool isn't to hard to find. It's a
matter of finding one with a long enough shaft to do the trick. 
 
No it is not a good idea to take that fan out.  Why because it will
cause stuff to over heat.  Internal hard drives, motherboard...You name
it and this can cause damage.  I've known people to have hard drive
failures because of fans that didn't work right....
