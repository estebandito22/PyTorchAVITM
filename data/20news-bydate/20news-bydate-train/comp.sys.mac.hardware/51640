I have a new 25 MHz Motorola 68040 that I am willing to sell if I get
a good enough offer.  It is still in its static free sealed package.

If I don't get a good enough offer, I will use it to replace my 68LC040.

Any takers?  

Supposedly you can get one of these for $375.  However, at the moment the
demand is higher than the supply so I think $400 is a good round number.
I will pay shipping, of course.

All offers should be send to lewallen@cis.ohio-state.edu
