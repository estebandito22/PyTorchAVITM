So far I have only seen pictures of the new ergonomic keyboard,
but it seems that the 'b' is placed on the left part after the split.
However, when I learned typing in school some years ago, I was taught
to write 'b' with my right hand. Is this a difference between Danish
and American typing, or what???

Thanks a lot in advance!
