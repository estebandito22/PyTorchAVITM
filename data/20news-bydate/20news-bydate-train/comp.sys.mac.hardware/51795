I have finally decided to update my SE :-)).
I am planning on buying a Centris 610-8/230 CD.
Now, what monitor should I get? Here are a few
guidelines:
	My wife uses PageMaker occasionally, I use Excel sometimes
	and I do alot of Telecommuting from home to work. We both
	do Word processing. Greater than 14 inches.

I have looked at the Radius Color Pivot. This can be bought for
under $1000. I have heard good things about the E-Machines T-16,
the older model not the new T-16 II. How about the Super Mac 17T?
These both can be had for a little over $1000. Any others??
