Subject: Quadra 800 problem & question
Lines: 16

I just got a Quadra 800 8/230 and I've noticed that I can't change the
desktop color from the beautiful gray.  I thought maybe I should reinstall
the OS using the "Install Me First, Macintosh Centris, Quadra..." diskette
because the system file on this diskette is more recent than the one on the
hard disk.

The easy install selects "Macintosh Cnetris System Software".  Does anyone
know if I should use this or customize and use "System Software for any
Macintosh"?  Or does it matter?

THANKS in advance for any suggestions...
