I've recently ordered a Centris 650 and need to decide on which modem to
buy.  I'm pretty sure I want to get a fax/data modem that can run at 14.4k,
but is it worth it?  I'll primarily only be 'conversing' over CompuServe or
some other link to the Internet, but I'm not sure if those systems can
supply ME with data at 14.4k.  Another question I have is in some of the
modem lingo out there.  I understand baud rates, but what does V3.4 and
V3.4bis mean?  I could really use some suggestions as to what a good modem
for around $300 would be, and why it would be a good choice.

Thanks for your time.
