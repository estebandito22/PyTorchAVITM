Flopticals have been available since the beginning of the year at $25
per floptical (= $1.20 per megabyte), and I have seen them advertised
in MacWEEK at $20 (< $1.00 per megabyte).  For someone on a tight
budget, the fact that the minimal dollar increment for more storage is
less---$25 versus $60---sometimes matters.
