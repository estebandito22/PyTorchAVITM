The problem is this:
After starting up my machine it gives a high pitched sound once at the desktop also it only does it when the mouse is up or a menu is not showing.

as if I click the mouse the noise goes away for the amount of time the mouse is down. also this problem only happens for about 5-10 minutes.

please let me know if you know what this is, it sounds like it is coming form the power supply.
Please Post here and Email me:

Thanks!
