Hi there,

when I run Disk First Aid on my external hard drive (Quantum LPS 240) I get the followinf
message: Error -535: Missing thread record (TarID=31015; TarBlock 416)
Disk First Aid is not able to fix this problem, Norton Utils doesn't find it at all.
When I use Norton Disk editor to look at TarBlock 416 I can read something like "DirReservedArea"

My question: How can I get rid of this error (without reformatting of course)
