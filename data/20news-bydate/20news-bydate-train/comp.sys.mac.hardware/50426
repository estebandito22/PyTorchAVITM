We're all set to buy one of these for the office, to use for scanning in
color photographs and for optical character recognition.  We've played with
the original grayscale OneScanner and were very pleased.  Is the color model
comparable in quality?

Also, what brand of OCR software would you recommend?  We're leaning toward
Caere OmniPage.  Any better ideas?  Thanks.
