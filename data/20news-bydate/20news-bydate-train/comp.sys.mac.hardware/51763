Hi,

The subject line says it all.  My system acts weird at times.  All of a
sudden the system will be corrupt, boot blocks will get chewed, etc.

This was a really big problem for a while.  I couldn't even format my
drive properly.  I installed HDT's driver and things got better.  Now
all I have to do is reinstall the system.  Could an incompatibility 
exist between it and a Quantum external drive.

I'm looking for a pure hardware solution.  It's not a virus, bad
software, etc.  Could I have a bad SCSI cable?  Or is the IBM (WDS-80)
just a screwey drive?

Thanks,

Chuck
