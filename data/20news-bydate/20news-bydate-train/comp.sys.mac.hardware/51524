	I too am interested in peoples' experience with accelerators for the
SE.  Is an accelerator the best route to improve performace in my SE, or should
I consider upgrading to an SE/30 motherboard?  Obviously, buying a new mac 
would be ideal, but alas, I only have enough money for an accelerator or
motherboard.
	E-mail reply preferred.  Thanks.
