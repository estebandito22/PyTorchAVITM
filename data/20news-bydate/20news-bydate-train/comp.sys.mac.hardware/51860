You macinators who have used these voice messaging/FAX/data-modems.  I
have a question.  First what brand names do you recommend(I am mostly
interested in the voice messaging and FAX part).  Is the voice part as
reliable and understandable as the sellers claim?  Approximately, how
much hard drive space does an average day of callers take up, if they
speak for one minute?  
Any feed back would be appreciated.  My company is looking at buying
one or two.  Hey, I may buy one myself too.

Thanks in advance
Don
