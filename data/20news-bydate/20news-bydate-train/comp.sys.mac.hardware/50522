You should be able to pick up an ADB cable at any computer wiring store...
I'd give you the address of Alberta Computer cable in Calgary, but a: I'm
in Victoria (B.C., Canada) and b: I don't think an address in Calgary would
help you too much....basically however I just phoned them up, and they
charged me approx. $15 cnd for a custom made ADB extension cable for my mouse.

Hope this helps...
