Readers,

I own a Mac IIsi and am considering upgrades (cards, hard drive, etc).
Can you tell me what the power limitations are for 1) the PDS slot
and 2) the hard drive power feed. Secondly, Can you tell me if there
is a separate limit for each, or if instead, there is a single limit
for both combined?

Please drop me a line if you know the answers to these questions.
Thanks,
