I'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGA
monitor (an IBM 8513 sold w/ many PS/2's to be exact) on the Mac LC III. 
All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work
on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the
sony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very
attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I
confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an
LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your
adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get a
apple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an
IBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can
afford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!
