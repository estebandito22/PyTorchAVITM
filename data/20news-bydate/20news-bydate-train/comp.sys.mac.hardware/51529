My MacClassic mouse died.  I dissected it and determined that it is
the microswitch, that senses the click, that is stuck in the depressed
mode.  This tragedy prompts the following questions:

1.	Is it easy to find a microswitch that I could solder into the
	place of the old switch ?

2.	I have old mice (Max+, Mac 512Ke), can they be used with some
	adapter ?
