Anyone Recognize this?  It's my little layout of a eight pin female plug
connector used for many mac peripherals.

#####Problem########Problem#########Problem########
  Printer (cheap) cables using this configuration switch a couple of
pins between one end and the other.  I want to use cheap cables for an
A-B box.  Anyone know which pins get reversed so I can do some
creative editing on the internals of my box?  Any help would be
greatly appreciated.
