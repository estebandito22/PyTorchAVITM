Anyone know what would cause my IIcx to not turn on when I hit the keyboard
switch?  The one in the back of the machine doesn't work either...
The only way I can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes,
then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately...
Sometimes this doesn't even work for a long time...

I remember hearing about this problem a long time ago, and that a logic 
board failure was mentioned as the source of the problem...is this true?
