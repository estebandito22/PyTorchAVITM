I've noticed some of you mentioning owning a Quadra 800 8/230 with CD300
and 1meg of VRAM.  It seems that this configuration was purchased
complete; that is, the CD300 and VRAM were already installed in the box. 
I am interested in that exact configuration and will be buying with an
educational discount but have not found the CD300 bundled with any Q800
smaller than the 8/500.
If you bought or know how to buy the 8/230 with CD installed, please let
me know what you know via email:
send messages to dmaluso@mhc.mtholyoke.edu
Thanks, all.
