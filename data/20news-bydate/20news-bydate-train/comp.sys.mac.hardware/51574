I am seeking recommendations/Vendors for a Networkable FAX. It would
mainly be used for outgoing FAX's from Mac's on our Net. The ability
to Fax from other platforms would be a plus. Ethernet interface would
be preffered but LocalTalk would suffice. Can anyone provide any info?
Thanks in advance, --Peter
