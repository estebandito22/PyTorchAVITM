I agree completely, but there was only a refund for people who bought the GC
with a Quadra. I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called
8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression
from the cpu to the AM29000 on the card. So it seems it can be done even though
in a developer article it states that the GC can't be programmed - but they
asked that any suggestions be sent in anyway...
