Ah, but why?  Can some technically-hip Macslinger tell us what the
difference is between PDS and Nubus?  

Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a
Nubus card cage?  At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to
locate one and neither have I.  What is the fundamental reason for
this?
