The Duo Powerbooks seem to park the heads after a few seconds of
inactivity... is that builtin into the drive logic or is it being
programmed via software, any way to tune the iddle timeout that
makes the heads park themselves... I think the heads are being
parked since after a few seconds of inactivity you can hear the
clunk of heads parking.
