In the MacUser article on the new centris and quadra machines mentioned
that the C650 and the Q800, and not the C610, had ROM accelerated video.

It didn't seem to make much difference in their "benchmark" test.

What is it?  I don't recall seeing it in Dale Adams post.

P.S.  could someone tell me if Dale's posts on video and memory are
archived somewhere.
