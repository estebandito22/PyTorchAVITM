Help!!!

I have an ADB graphicsd tablet which I want to connect to my
Quadra 950. Unfortunately, the 950 has only one ADB port and
it seems I would have to give up my mouse.

Please, can someone help me? I want to use the tablet as well as
the mouse (and the keyboard of course!!!).

Thanks in advance.
