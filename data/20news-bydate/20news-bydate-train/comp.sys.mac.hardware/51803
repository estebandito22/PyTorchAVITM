   I seem to be having some trouble with this...

   I can get the mac to go to sleep, but I can't make seem to 
make it wake up with SetWUTime().  I am aware of the error in
the header files and IM VI.  I am setting the WU time to be
about two minutes, then putting the mac to sleep, but it doesn't
wakeup at the appointed time....

   Does it require a call to SystemTask in order to make sure that
everything is setup?
