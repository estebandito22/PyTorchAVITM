The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz, so driving it
at 60.24KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance            The 4FG is spec'ed at 57KHz, so going 60.24KHz is only 5-6% above
the minimally guaranteed figure.

I too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at 1024 x 768.            Like most things, you get what you pay.  That's the deal.

P.S. I wouldn't have posted if I wasn't sure.
