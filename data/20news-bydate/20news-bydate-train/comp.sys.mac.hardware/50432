A couple of questions for the multimedia set:


1.  Does anybody have a phone or fax number, or e-mail address, or name of a
principal in CEDAR Technologies in Dublin, New Hampshire? All I have is a
post-office box number, and I want to ask a couple of questions before
sending
them some money.  Any info much appreciated.

2.  I'm running an SE/30, which came with no microphone. Is there any way,
other than using MacRecorder with SoundEdit or CEDAR's digitizer with some
similar software, to input recorded sound into my Mac? I'm trying to play
some
very short interview clips in a HyperCard stack.

Thanks for any and all help.
