I've got two CD300's... The first one i ordered Jan 15, and I received it Feb. 20.
The second one I ordered Jan 20th, and I just got it April 2nd or so. Anyway, they
both come with 10 misc. CDROMs... Things like a "Intro to Nautilis", a sample CD
of Kodak pictures, "From Alice to Ocean" (a story of a woman who treked across
Austrailia), 3 discs from apple, a games disc, an applications disc, and a "titles"
disc (haven't checked most of these out yet). Also some "Cinderella" thing for kids,
a disc of Mozart something-or-others, etc. etc. etc. If someone's super interested,
I'll make a list of the exact titles and post them. They are all in the category of
"Interesting, but probably fairly useless...". It was rumored that the earliest 
units shipped with SOME encyclocpedia (it may have), but neither of my drives had
that.
