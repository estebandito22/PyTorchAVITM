  Yes, E-Machines makes two mini-docks--the Powerlink Presente and the
PowerLink DeskNet. The Presenter offers a variety of video-out options, 
including NTSC, RGB and SVGA. It also has sound out, floppy drive port
and a power port. Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port.
  The DeskNet has the standard ports plus built-in EtherNet. Alas, none of
these have an FPU.
  In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes
me now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and "Quadra" comparable
video speed. No idea if it has an FPU.
  Hope this helps...
