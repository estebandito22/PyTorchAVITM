if you have a memory card installed that's not one of apple's, this
may be the problem.  for a couple of months after the release of
the duo, some memory manufacturers were shipping duo memory cards w/
improper (non-self-refreshing) chips.  if you have a third party 
card, pull it and see if the sleep problem recurs.
