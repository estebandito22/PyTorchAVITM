1.  Why, or how actually, can a Powerbook have a 640 x 400 pixel
    display, regardless if it is a 9" or 10", and still keep the
    72 dpi resolution?  (I assume that it doesn't, and I don't 
    mean to imply they *all* have these dimensions)


2.  Any info on price drops or new models (non-Duo) coming up?



Thanks,
JT
