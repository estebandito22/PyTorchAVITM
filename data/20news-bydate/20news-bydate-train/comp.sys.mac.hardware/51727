	Hello,

	I remember running across an ad in the back of Mac[User|World]
a few years ago, for a Nubus board that had umpteen SIMM slots, to be
used to "recycle your old SIMMs," when you upgraded memory.  I don't
remember who made this board, and I haven't seen it advertised in
any of the latest Mac magazines.  It mentioned that it included software
to make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk. As someone who has SIMMS 
he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorly
good idea.  Does anyone out there know what board/company I'm talking about?  
Are they still in business, or does anyone know where I can get a used one
if they are no longer made?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please
e-mail me, to save net.bandwidth.


	Thanks,

	Cap.
