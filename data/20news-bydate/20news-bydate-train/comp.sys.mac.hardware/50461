I have been playing with my Centris 610 for almost a week now.  I must say
this machine is really fast!  The hardware turn-on feature is annoying, but
I got PowerKey from Sophisicated Circuits and it works like a charm.

However, I still have a few complaints:
- when I restart the machine every time, the screen image (the desktop
  pattern) jerks up and down for a few times.
- the Quantum 170 drive is noisy

Overall, I highly recommend it:  it is fast, affordable and looks great!
