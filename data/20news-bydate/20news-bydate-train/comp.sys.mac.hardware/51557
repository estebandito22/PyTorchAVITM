I just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it.  My
needs
are much the same as what you describe.  In addition, I wanted to get one
that
I could access via AppleTalk, so that eliminated the new line of
inexpensive 
printers from Apple.  The print quality is good to excellent based on
what 
font you're using and what paper you use.  I'm still experimenting with 
different papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work
fine.

Printing envelopes, transpariencies, letter head, or other single feed
jobs is
very easy.  There is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of
the
sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet
from
the sheet feeder, as some do).

(I have no affiliation with GCC, just a satisfied customer.)
