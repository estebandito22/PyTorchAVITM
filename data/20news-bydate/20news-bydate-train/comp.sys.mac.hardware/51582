I recall reading that the Mac LC (and presumably the LC II & III) can use stand
ard VGA monitors, with appropriate cable adapters.  I am uncertain of this sinc
e I have asked other people who say this is not so.  So can all vga monitors be
 used on the Mac LC?  What are the specs needed for a PC monitor to work with a
Mac LC (horizontal nad vertical frequencies)?
