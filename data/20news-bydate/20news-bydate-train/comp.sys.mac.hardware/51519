Excuse me if this is a frequent question, I checked in
several FAQs but couldn't really find anything.

I have a IIsi with the standard 5 meg memory and I want
(need) to add additional memory.  But I'm on a budget.
I really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what is
the best (performance wise) and most economical way
to do this?  Someone told me that I should only use
SIMMs of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg,
4 2 meg, etc.  What if I just wanted to buy just 1 4 meg
and use the rest of what I already have?  The manual
hasn't been very helpful with this.

Thanks.
