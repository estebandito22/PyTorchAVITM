The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector 
are close to each other, and if you happen to bend the
cable a little while inserting it, you short the ADB
port. If you take it to an Apple Repair Centre, that
means a new motherboard (though a component replace IS
physically possible)

Same goes for serial ports (LocalTalk as well)
