From the benchmarks I've seen (was that in MacUser or MacWeek?) the FPU-less
Centris 610 is _faster_ at floating-point operations (the kind of calculations
that get routed to an FPU) than a Mac IIfx!

And a Mac IIfx (68030 @ 40MHz + FPU) is _the_ fastest 030-based Mac.

Take note, of course, that benchmarks never tell the whole story... Get your
favorite program(s) and run them on both machines at the store.  They should
let you do that before you plunk down a hefty amount...

Virtually,
Philippe
