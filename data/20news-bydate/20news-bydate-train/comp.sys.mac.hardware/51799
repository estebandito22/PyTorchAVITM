Please could someone in the US give me the current street 
prices on the following, with and without any relevant taxes:

 8 Mb 72 pin SIMM
16 Mb 72 pin SIMM (both for Mac LC III)

Are any tax refunds possible if they are to be exported
to the UK? Can you recommend a reliable supplier?

As I am posting this from a friend's account, please
reply direct to me at:

Thanks in advance for any help  :^)
