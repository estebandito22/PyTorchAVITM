   My mac monitor displays about 20 vertical lines when I use it.
It means that either my display memory goes wrong or monitor is bad
or video card is bad.
   I checked my monitor, it works fine with other Mac.
   I checked my video card, it's also fine.
   I replaced all the RAMs, it still didn't give me right answer.
   Hence I assume something wrong with some part of my motherboard.

   I don't know hardware architecture of the Macintosh.

   Can anyone tell me what's the problem ????

   It's a Mac IIcx.


   MANY THANKS IN ADVANCE.
