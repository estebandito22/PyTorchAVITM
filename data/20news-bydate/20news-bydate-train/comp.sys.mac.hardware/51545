The service notice on the 13" hi-res monitors expired 3/23/93 after this  
date Apple will NOT reimburse service providers for the fix (replacement  
of the hi-voltage capacitor). All you folks that have been putting up with  
intermittant shutdowns without getting it to your service provider missed  
out on the freebie. It was in force for a year. If you got it free after  
3/23, you got a deal...
