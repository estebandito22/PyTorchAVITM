Subject: Accelerating the MacPlus...;)

We're about ready to take a bold step into the 90s around here by accelerating
our rather large collection of stock MacPlus computers. Yes indeed, difficult
to comprehend why anyone would want to accelerate a MacPlus, but that's another
story. Suffuce it to say, we can get accelerators easier than new machines.
Hey, I don't make the rules...

Anyway, on to the purpose of this post: I'm looking for info on MacPlus
acelerators.  So far, I've found some lit on the Novy Accelerator and the
MicrMac MultiSpeed Accelartor. Both look acceptable, but I would like to hear
from anyone who has tried these.  Also, if someone would recommend another
accelerator for the MacPlus, I'd like to hear about it.

Thanks for any time and effort you expend on this!

Karl
