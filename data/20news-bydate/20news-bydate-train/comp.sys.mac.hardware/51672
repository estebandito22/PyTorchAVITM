I asked a question a week or so ago about getting more res. on my monitor. I have a Magnavox MagnaScan/17 and am wondering what video cards it supports. ALso, does anybody  have Magnavox's EMail ID (if there is one) or maybe a phone number? Please reply by email as I don't read much news.

Thanks,
Steve
