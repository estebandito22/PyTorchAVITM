I'm thinking about upgrading my 030 50MHz to the 040 33version.  Has anyone
had any experience with the accelerator, and if so - what do you think?
Any problems, what are the speedometer results?, is it much faster than
the 50MHz?  Basically, I'd appreciate hearing all about this product.  Please
respond via email, and I'll summarize if there's a big response.  thanks
in advance, Andrew
