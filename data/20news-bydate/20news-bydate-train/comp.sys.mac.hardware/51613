I don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your
message, but I definitely had SCSI problems between my
Q700 and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive 10 cartridge
drives.  My solution was to get Silverlining.  None of
the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives;
in fact the only loop that worked was the "Macintosh
Software" loop (whatever that means).
