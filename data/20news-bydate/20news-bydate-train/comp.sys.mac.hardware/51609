Ravi,

	Its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a  
vertical position.  If the drive is formatted in a horizontal position, it can  
not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position.   
I'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 6 months from now, but  
why take that chance?  If you want more detailed info on the problem, please  
mail me at:===> sunnyt@dna.bchs.uh.edu <===.  

Sunny
