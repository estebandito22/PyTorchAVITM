I bought a Bernoulli 90pro drive last year after comparing it with lots of
 diffrent storage solutions,
OPTICAL drives are SLOW, very slow compared to 13 to 19ms access of Bernoulli.

Since I needed additinol online storage (rather than just a backup or archiev
e disk), I choosed Bernoulli drive. I use Adobe Preimere and Quicktime movies
alot. you ran out of storage real fast.

IMHO, the best buy currently is the Bernoulli 150Multidisk. 150MB per cartridge
