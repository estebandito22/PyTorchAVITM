I recently upgraded to System 7.1 and now I also upgraded my
DeskWriter drivers from 2.2 to 3.1.  I got the software from Sumex,
but it is not clear to me where to install what.

Can someone tell me which of the files that come with DW-3.1 go where
and for what purpose?  What can be left out, for instance, if
you don't want to do background printing?

Thanks,

	Tom
