You are excused... the answer varies from Mac to Mac so it would be
a complex answer in the FAQ.

: I really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what is
: the best (performance wise) and most economical way
: to do this?  Someone told me that I should only use
: SIMMs of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg,
: 4 2 meg, etc.  What if I just wanted to buy just 1 4 meg
: and use the rest of what I already have?  The manual
: hasn't been very helpful with this.
: 
The si uses a 32 bit wide data bus and therefore you must use 4 8-bit
wide simms.  Sorry, but no short cuts here.

: Thanks.

You're quite welcome.
