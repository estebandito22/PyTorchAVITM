Forgive me if this has been asked before... but here goes:

My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot? CompUsa and
ComputerCity Supercenter says they don't carry them.

Does this mean LC III is incapable of carrying a NuBus board?

Much obiliged,
Marvin
