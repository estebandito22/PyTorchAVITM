Subject: $$$ to fix TRACKBALL
Lines: 11

The trackbal on my PB140 no longer moves in the horizontal direction.  When I
called the nearest Authorized Apple Service person I was told that it probably
needed replacing and that would cost me over $150!  Ouch!
  Can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem?  One strange
symptom of the problem is that when I take the ball out of the socket and shine
a light into the hole I can make the cursor move horizontally by moving the
wheel with my finger, it works fine that way but won't work if I turn off the
light.  Any suggestions or comments?
