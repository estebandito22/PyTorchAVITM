1)    I have an old Jasmine drive which I cannot use with my new system.
 My understanding is that I have to upsate the driver with a more modern
one in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1.  does anyone know
of an inexpensive program to do this?  ( I have seen formatters for <$20
buit have no idea if they will work)
 
2)     I have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which
the back utility freezes the system if I try to use it.  THe drive is a
jasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar
mechanism).  Essentially I have the same question as above, anyone know
of an inexpensive beckup utility I can use with system 7.0.1
 
all help and advice appriciated.
