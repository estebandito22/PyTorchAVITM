I tried the right set and it didn't work.  I'm on the phone to their
tech support right now and the guys doesn't know what a desktop
rebuild is!!!  He's got me holding for someone else...............
And holding, and holding, and holding.

Ok they finally got back to me and said basically "it should work".
Well it doens't and they don't know why.  Guess it will go back to
MacConnection and I'll buy something else.  I've got better things
to do than play musical keyboards.
