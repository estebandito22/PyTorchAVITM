I have just a few quick questions.  Does anyone here have a 486 DLC
system? (a Cyrix 486 DX)  Any problems with it?  
Second, how much should a Cyric 486DLC-33 motherboard (with
no RAM) run me?  
3rd...Should a total amatuer (like myslef) be able to perform
a motherboard swap without the aid of a technician, or is it
beyond hope?
4th...I hear that some (if not all) hard drives may require reformatting
if you switch them to another computer (or motherboard as the case may
be).  Is there any truth to this?

Any replies would be greatly appreciated.
