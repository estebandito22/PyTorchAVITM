Hi!
I got hold of an old Zenith 286 Laptop with model# ZWL-183-45

The hard-disk is dead but the rest seems to work. I took the Zenith apart and found a very strange
disk for wich I now try to replace.

The disk is marked JVC, model JD3824R00-1.
Has anyone any specs. on this disk or suggestion where i can find it or a cheap replacement for it.

Thanks for your help.
