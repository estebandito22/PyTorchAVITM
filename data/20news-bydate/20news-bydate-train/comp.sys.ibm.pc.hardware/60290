AAAHHHH!!!!!  Please someone tell me what I have done!!!

My 40 Meg miniscribe (8450AT) has a big sticker on the side that says

***DO NOT ROTATE INTERRUPTER** --->  (big knob here)

A big knob sticking off the side of the drive is pretty hard NOT to turn
when removing the drive!

I turned it.   Now the drive won't spin up!  Even with no data or controller
cables plugged in.. just power... it won't spin up!!

Please help!  

Thanks
