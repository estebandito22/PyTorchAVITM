We have a Gateway 486DX50 with a SMC Elite16 Series Ethercard Plus.

When we use NCSA FTP to send from the Gateway with hash turned on, we see
4 hash marks immediately.  Then the computer  r e a l l y  drags.  If we turn 
off the internal cache of the 486, the speed is better, but doesn't match
the speed when we receive to the Gateway.

It doesn't matter if we send from the Gateway or get to it: 4 hash marks and 
then extreme slowness if the cache is not disabled.

Does anyone know any more about this?  Is there a fix?

The Gateway was purchased in June, 1992.

Please respond directly.  You wouldn't believe how slow the news is on this 
system.   

Thanks.
