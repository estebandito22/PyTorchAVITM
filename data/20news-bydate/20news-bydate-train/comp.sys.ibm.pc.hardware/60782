Lines: 11

I own an 8088 640K clone which does all I want except run 1 game I want
to buy.  The game says it requires a 80286 with 640K.  Game tech. support
says game will run on 8088 but uses a some digitized graphics which would
make it run really *slow* (it's a card game - Hoyles Classic Card Games,
digitized graphics are photos artwork of game fictional card players).

What can I do to speed up how this game would run, short of an 80286
motherboard upgrade.  Co-processor?  Accelerator card mimicking 80286?
My 8088 can run at 10 Mhz.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
