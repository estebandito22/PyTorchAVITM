         No cache, also called 386DX.

>80386SX:  Emulates 80386 with a 16 bit bus.
     It has the same internals as the 386, is a real 32-bit processor, just has
     16 bit hookup to the outside world.

>80486:  True 32 bit processor.
>        Internal mathematical coprocessor (Correct?)
            Yes, optimized 387 internal.
>        Internal cache (Correct? How big?)
            Yes, 8K.
>        (extended instruction set in any way?)
            Yes, but only a few instructions, nothing noteworthy.

>80486SX:  Probably sorta like 80486...
            486 with no coprocessor.

>80486DX:  Probably sorta like 80386...
            Nope.  Just another name for the 486.
