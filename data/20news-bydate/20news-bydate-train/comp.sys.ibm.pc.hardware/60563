PLEASE: response directly to me (luoma@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)
        by email.  IF there are a sufficient number of interesting
        responses, I will post a summary (on April 24 or 25).

I have waded through the mass of SCSI-IDE posting, but
I missed any answers to a question posted early on --

Has anyone (successfully) put both SCSI and IDE hard drives
on the same system?

I am particularly interested in having the SCSI as the _boot_ drive.

For those who have managed this feat, I would appreciate
a bit more information, such as what drives, which SCSI controller,
and (if possible) what motherboard & BIOS
(plus any other relevant info.).

Thanks in advance,
