I'm looking for a better method to back up files.  Currently using a MaynStream
250Q that uses DC 6250 tapes.  I will need to have a capacity of 600 Mb to 1Gb
for future backups.  Only DOS files.

I would be VERY appreciative of information about backup devices or
manufacturers of these products.  Flopticals, DAT, tape, anything.  
If possible, please include price, backup speed, manufacturer (phone #?), 
and opinions about the quality/reliability.

Please E-Mail, I'll send summaries to those interested.

Thanx in advance,
