The F550iW is optimized for Windows.  It powers down when the screen
blanker appears, it powers down with you turn your computer off, and it
meets all of the Swedish standards.  It's also protected against  EMI from
adjacent monitors. 

Personally, I think the F550i is more bang for the buck right now.
