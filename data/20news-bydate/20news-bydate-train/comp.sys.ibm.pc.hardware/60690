Subject: HOW is a Null Modem Cable?
Organization: Muskingum College
Lines: 13


	I am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem
cable. (Actually I have NO idea, so don't count that last statement.)  What I'm
asking is what pins does it use (or what are it's specifications?)  I just want
to solder one myself instead of buying one.  I don't even know what port is
used.

Help me please (at ke_kimmell@vax.cns.muskingum.edu)

Kevin

p.s.  I'm intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers (via Lap-Link or
Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.)
