Please reply via e-mail since this is job related: 

I have a Colorado Jumbo back-up system at one of my places of 
employment and it has eaten two tapes by winding the tape off the spool.

Is there an easy fix or is the tape drive fried? Does it simply need 
cleaning?

Any and all comments will be appreciated!
