Excuse me to every one.
I am an Amiga owner and tired to have the same graphic modes.
So I saw on nn there was a little bridgeboard that made the
Amiga's PC slots communicate with the stanndard Amiga's slot.
The building mother house of this little gadget assure me
that using this thing I can use all the pc boards included
the SVGA cards.
I am interested in computer graphics and I do not know many
things about pc in general.
So, what is the best (ISA slot) card on the market ?
I'd like to reach resolutions like 1280x1024 with 256
colors or 800x600 with 24 bitplanes.

Any suggestion ??

thankyou in advance
