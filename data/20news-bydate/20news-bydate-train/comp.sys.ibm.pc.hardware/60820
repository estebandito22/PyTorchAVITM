I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one
I already had.  My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable
for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors
on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, 
the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable
with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But
for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug
in the cable to align these.  
Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.
I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into
the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the "master" drive
and which into the "Slave"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...
