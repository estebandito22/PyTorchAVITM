 I have recently plunged into PC World. I have been using Amigas before.
 Trying to establish a network (LAN) here that could use 2 different printers.
 Panasonic KXP2124 for printing receipts and Okidata OL400 for letters etc.
 Is it at all possible in this world ? I know when using Unix etc I can specify
 which printer to print from. But I am not sure how PCs would handle that. If
 they can't then I guess I'll leave PeeeCeees for good and move on to Unix.
