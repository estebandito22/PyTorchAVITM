Hello,

I am looking for a PC card with the following features:

  - Controller for IDE(AT-Bus)-HardDiskDrive
  - Controller for 2 FloppyDiskDrives
  - Standard(256KB) VGA Graphics  INCLUDING FEATURE CONNECTOR (important!)
                                  ===========================

There *are* some manufacturors/distributors of this kind of card, but I have
not found them yet.

If you can help me, please mail to:  ICH344@DJUKFA11
                                     ICH344@zam001.zam.kfa-juelich.de


Thanks a lot,
                                                   Martin Mueller
