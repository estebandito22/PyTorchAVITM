     I would like to thank all those people who responded to my post.  I 
would, however, like to clear some things up.  My tape drive is *external*.
Also, the connector on the back of it is of the male DB-37 pin variety.
As a result, I cannot easily find a cost-effective solution to use the drive.

     Any advice will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer email.
     Thanks!
