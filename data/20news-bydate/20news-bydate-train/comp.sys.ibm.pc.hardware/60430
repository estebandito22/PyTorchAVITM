I just picked up a second-hand "color option" for the NEC P5200
24pin dot matrix printer.  Alas, there were no installation instructions,
so I am totally confused on WHY it WON'T GO IN!

Do I have to remove the actaual print head?  It seems *almost* to fit,
but not quite.

Please... any info would be most appreciated!
