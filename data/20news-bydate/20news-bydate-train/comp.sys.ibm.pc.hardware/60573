Keith,

I had a problem getting 256 colors (I was stuck with 16) even though
the flex-stuff said I was at 1024-256.  I solved it by entering
the 'advanced' window on the flex program pannel and changing the
'color palette'.  Sorry for the vaugeness, I hope it helps some.

BTW, I have a GW2000-66V and 1M ATI GUP.
