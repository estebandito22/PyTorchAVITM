Good luck finding an MX17S.  When I was looking around back in
December/January, Mag wasn't producing any because they couldn't get
tubes from Sony.  I asked when they expected to restart production as
I was willing to wait a few months to get an MX17S but they said not
any time soon.  I wound up getting a T560i and am extremely happy with
it.
