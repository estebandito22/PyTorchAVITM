Subject: Wanted ISA mouse port with high interrupt

With a sound card on interrupt 5, two serial ports (one for modem on i4,
one for Miracle Piano on i3) and a printer port on i7, I have run out of
low interrupts.  What I would like is a mouse port with an interrupt of
10, 11, or 12 (which ever interrupt the PS/2 mouse port uses) in in ISA
i486 computer.  I called technical support of Microsoft, Logitech, & ATI
(checked what interrupts the mouse port on the ATI video cards can use)
and they all said the only interrupts possible on these cards was ones
lower than 7.  Does anyone know of any board for an ISA bus which will
allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts?
