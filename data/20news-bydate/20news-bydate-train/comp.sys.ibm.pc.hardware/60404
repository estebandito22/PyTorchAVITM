OK, I'll try one more time with this one. If ANYONE out there has ANY
information on MicroScience hard drives and how to set the jumpers
(and where they are?) for master/slave configurations. I will gladly
accept any info, as I have a 110M'er sitting in my room collecting dust
just waiting for me to install huge applications. :) Thanks in advance.
(And yes, I regulary check the IDE Harddisk Spec that is posted here.)
