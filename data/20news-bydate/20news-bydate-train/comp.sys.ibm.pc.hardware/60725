Hi all,  
   
    
    Could anybody please tell me where I might be able to find device drivers 
for a couple of older Gateway ethernet cards?  I don't have the model number
off hand, but they have only a BNC connector, and a header connector for 
a Novell keycard (one has one installed).
 
    I'm looking at using these with a 2 node copy of 10-net that I picked up
at a swap meet.  (I'd love to do Lantastic or Netware lite, but I'm a poor
college student and the price was right.)

    Please reply via email, as I haven't had a lot of time for news because
of exams and such.
