Have you checked: 1/ The setting of drive A: to 1.44 M floppy.
						2/ The setting of drive B: to 1.2 M foppy.
						3/ The cable connecting the two drives to
						the controller card (I can't remember which
						two wires are swapped, but they determine
						which is drive A: & b:).

I hope this is of some help :-)
