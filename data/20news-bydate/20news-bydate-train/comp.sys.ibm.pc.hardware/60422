Subject: Wanted: Advice/comments on building a PC

In the next few months I am intending to build a 386 or 486 PC system
for remote monitoring. I would welcome any comments or advice you may
have on the choice of motherboard, HDDs and I/O boards. Recommendations
for good companies selling these would be a big help.

Many thanks,

Peter Green.
