Subject: QUESTION: How to get serial mouse working on IBM notebook L40?
Organization: Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, The Netherlands
Lines: 13

Do you happen to know how I can get a serial mouse (9 pins) working on
an IBM L40 notebook (which has a kind of bus mouse connection besides serial
and parallel interfaces). The manual doesn't say anything about it.

I've tried two drivers, with the result that left and right buttons are
recognized, but mouse movement is not. Should I cut or shortcut some
wires to/from the mouse?

Thanks for your help.
