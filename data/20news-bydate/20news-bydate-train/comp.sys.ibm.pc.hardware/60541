Hi, all hardware netters,

  I've seen recently on some magazines advertising a ?NEW? Trident
graphics card call 8900CL. The ad said it's new and *faster*. How is it
compare to Tseng ET4000? BTW, which is the fastest *non-accelerated* SVGA
on the market? Any info or benchmark are welcome. Thanks in advance.
