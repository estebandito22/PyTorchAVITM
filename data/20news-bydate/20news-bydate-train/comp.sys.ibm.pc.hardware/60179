Dear All,

	I am trying to get my standard connection going with KA9Q (PA0GRI113016)
and a GVC NIC-2000 ethernet card. I know that my router and modem is
working because I am able to ping, finger, and even telnetd with it.

	However, after a time, it crashes randomly. Help would be
greatly appreciated.

	I suspect that there is a hardware conflict in the PC.  I am
running with a 386SX/33, 2 MB Ram.  The Ethernet card is configured
for IRQ 5, ports 0x360-0x37F. 

	Thanks in advance. I know that it's not much to go on, but I
don't even know what the questions to ask are, sorry.

Please send mail.

Elliott
