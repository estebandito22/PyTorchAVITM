Hi,

I just disassembled my old XT and get 2 disk drives - 30M hard drive and a 
360K floppy drive.  My questions are:

 -can I use these 2 drives as drives D & E on my 386SX25 ?  This 386SX25
  currently has 80M hard drive, 1.2M & 1.44M floppy drives.

 -if I can, what s/w or h/w do I need ?

 Please send your advice/comments to aovai@qube.ocunix.on.ca

 Thanks a lot,

 AV
