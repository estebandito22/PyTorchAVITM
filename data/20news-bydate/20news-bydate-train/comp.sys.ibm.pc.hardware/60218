Oh yeah! I just got my new Eizo Flexscan yesterday (to replace my old 8515), and
I tried it with 1360x1024. This mode is just great! I can get four perfectly readable
command windows on the screen! And if I need more colors, I can go back to 1024x768
or even 800x600.
One thing I am wondering though: Why isn't there a MONxxxx.DGS file which contains
ALL the resolutions up to 1360x1024? Now I have to change the XGASETUP.PRO every
time I want to switch, instead of simply going through the system settings of OS/2.
