I started a similar thread about a month ago, and got many replies.
The summary:

CTX 14": Nasty, low quality. Avoid.

CTX 15" Proscan: Not as good as some other makes; however, cheap.
  Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning
  (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.

I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay
shipping) and returned to me in 2 days. 

It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel
distortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digital
controls and mode memory are nice. Certainly, a Trinitron
(say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range.

Conclusion: If you're on a budget, get one and be prepared to
send it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it,
but has good potential.
