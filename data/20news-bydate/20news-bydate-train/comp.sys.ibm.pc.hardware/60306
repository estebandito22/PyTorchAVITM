Well, I figured out how the jumpers go.  Now I have quite a different
problem that has me perplexed like you wouldn't know.  I have both drives
working, the C: system formatted and all of my hardware installed.  Only
problem is, that during the boot up sequence, the computer does not want
to pass up looking for a system on the A: drive.

Reinitialization all goes fine and the BIOS seems to be configured to
what is necessary.  All the drive tests work, but when the thing comes
back around to the a: drive and there is no disk present, it just spins.
If you insert a disk into drive a with a system however, it works fine
and boots up (ie how installed all my software)

Any additional help on this will be most welcome....
