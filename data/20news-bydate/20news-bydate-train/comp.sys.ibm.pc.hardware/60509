Except from clock frequency, what are the differences between the
various types of 386 and 486 processors?
The following is a list with what I know (or perhaps only what I
think I know!). Can anybody extend & correct?


80386:  True 32 bit processor.
        (cache?)

80386SX:  Emulates 80386 with a 16 bit bus.

80486:  True 32 bit processor.
        Internal mathematical coprocessor (Correct?)
        Internal cache (Correct? How big?)
        (extended instruction set in any way?)

80486SX:  Probably sorta like 80486...

80486DX:  Probably sorta like 80386...


Well, it's not much, but I'm sure there is a lot of people out there
who can add a lot of information. Post or email as you prefer.
