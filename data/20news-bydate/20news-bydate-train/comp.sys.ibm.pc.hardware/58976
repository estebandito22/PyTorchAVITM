Hi netters!
	I often have troubles with my PC and would like to fix it by myself.  Is 
	there any book that show you how to fix your own PC (hardware, monitor,
	printer problems..etc).  Of course, no book would tell you the exact
	problem with your PC, but at least it will give a general idea what
	might be wrong.  Thanks so lot for your help.
