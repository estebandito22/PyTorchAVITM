Cyrix have released a 386 pin-conpatible 486 clone. Designed to upgrade
old 16 & 20MHz 386's the chips are also clockdoubling. Thus a 16MHz 386
can be transformed into a 32MHz 486, with a single chip upgrade.

Unfortunately in Australia the DRu2 sells for $700A (16MHz) and $1000A
(20MHz), about 1.5x the price of a 486dx33 motherboard with two vlb slots!!!

How much do these thing cost in the States?
How well do they work?

Thanks for any info,
