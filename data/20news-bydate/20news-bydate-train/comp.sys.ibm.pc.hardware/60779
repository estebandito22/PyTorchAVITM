	Hi everyone,
	I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming 
in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep 
getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the 
program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so 
I can't seem to explain why it crashes.

All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and
after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads
me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.  

Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions
that do not return anything??

	I have been working on this problem for days and I would really
appreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup, I will
gladly re-post, but this is the only I could find.

Thanks in advance,
Sean Mars
