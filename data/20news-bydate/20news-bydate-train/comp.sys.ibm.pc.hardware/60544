Hi,

I just bought a Mitsumi CD-ROM drive and a SB Pro soundcard.  The pin outs on
the CD-ROM line-out and the SB Pro CD-IN are not the same.  I am considering
taking the RCA output jacks on the Mitsumi interface card and routing them to
the line-in input on the SB Pro.  Will this work with multi-media software
that uses the CD-ROM and the SB Pro or do I need to go to the CD-IN pins on
the SB-Pro.

Thanks,

John
