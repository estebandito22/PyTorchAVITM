Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be
the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard
is COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very
poorly written.  But then most of the programs in MS-DOS are crap, such
as the PRINT command TSR that locks up your system for long periods of
time when the printer is full instead of trying every clock tick.

Back to comm software... I find success with TELIX (my COM3 at 3e8/5
works ok on TELIX).
