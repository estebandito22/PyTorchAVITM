Get back to your vendors, or better yet the board manufactures and get
some more info:
   Where made.
   Norton indexes (yeah I know BMs suck but whats a mother to do?)
   number of slots, and types, # ESIA and # 32 bit?
   Any IDE or SCSI on board?
   How easy to upgrade RAM, location and # of pins.
   OVERDRIVE?
   Oscilator kits?
   Does it have a 16550 UART?
   Who's BIOS?

These might make you feel better about either system, but I must 
agree that Ares with 7 days of 24 hr Tech and 2 year warranty is
encouraging.
