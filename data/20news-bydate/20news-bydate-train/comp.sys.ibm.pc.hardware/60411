Can anybody please help me with information on the use of the bi-directional
printer port.

I have successfully used one on a Toshiba laptop by enabling bit 0 of port
0x37f and controlling bit 7 of port 0x37a for the direction of data flow (ie
"0" for output, "1" for input).

The same code does not work on my desktop machine. I have heard that i might
have to use bit 5 of port 0x37a, however this also does not work.

For a parallel port i am using one of those IDE SUPER I/O cards and have been
running a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am
pretty sure that the printer port is bi-directional.


Any information would be greatly appreasiated.

Please post a reply here or Email me on

Thanks
