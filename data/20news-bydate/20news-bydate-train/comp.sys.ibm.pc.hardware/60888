I have been following this mess for a while. excuse my need for
clarification.  Iam thinking seriously IDE vs. SCSI and this thread
could not have come at a better time.

the above quote SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip}

are we talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller
or 
are we talking about a SCSI-1 Controller that had a chip upgrade
using the same chip that is on a SCSI-2 controller board.

thanks
