I've been troubleshooting the existence of way too many General Protection
Faults on a 486-33, Eisa-VLB, system.  At this point I think I've narrowed
the problem down to the video drivers for the Volante Warp-10 adapter by
National Design, INc.

Yet somehow I find this hard to believe.  Does anyone else have any
experiences with this board.

Thanx,
