I'm looking for a complete hw/sw solution:
I need an ISA/VLB scsi controller (e.g Ultrastor 34F)
plus a tape drive (500Mb or less like Archive) plus a Windows
program that will work on these.

My intended system will have 32Mb RAM so
plain ISA controllers will no longer do.
But I also hear that the SCSI world
is not very organized.

So does anybody have a tape backup setup
like what I'm looking for ? Please
describe it.

Thanks. e-mail please.
