Hi,

Can anyone tell me the difference between ~30-pin and 72-pin Simms?
I wish to get detailed information about the origin of these two
different types of Simms, preferably a magazine review aricle.

By the way, if there is a FAQ for this group which covers the Simms
information, please also direct me to it.

Any help/information would be very much appreciated.


Sincerely,
