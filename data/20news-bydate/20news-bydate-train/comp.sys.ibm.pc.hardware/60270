I don't know if this is an obvious question, but can any of the current 
batch of windows accelerator cards (diamond etc) be used to drive a monitor 
which has RGB and horizontal and vertical sync ( 5 BNC jacks altogether) 
connectors out the back??  I might be able to get ahold of a Raster 
Technologies 17" monitor (1510 ??)cheap and I was wondering if it was 
possible to connect it via an adapter (RGB to vga ??) to my Gateway, would 
I need different drivers etc.  


Thanks
