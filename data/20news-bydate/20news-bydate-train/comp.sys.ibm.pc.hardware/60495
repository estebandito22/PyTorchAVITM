Hello netters,

	I have a question concerning SCSI on DOS.

	I have a ST01 SCSI controller and two hard-disks conected
	(id's 0 and 1). I'd like to connect a SCSI streamer, but I
	don't have software to access it. Does such a beast exist
	as shareware or PD ?
	
	Also what if I want a third disk ? I know that DOs only can
	"see" two two physical and four logical disks. Will it be
	possible to use extra disks ?

	Thanks in advance.

	Ib
