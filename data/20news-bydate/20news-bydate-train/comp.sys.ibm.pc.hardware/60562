Summary: help me....

Okay, I'm trying to install NCSA telnet on a couple (okay, a whole bunch)
of machines.  They're all true blue IBMs with either Fallon Phonenet cards
or Dastar cards.  (I belive those names are correct.)  Well, the docs for
telnet say that it'll run over an AppleTalk driver, but I've had little
success.

If anyone has succesfully installed Telnet w/ AppleTalk, I'd like some
help with the config file for Telnet...

BTW, please reply via E-mail if possible...

Thanks,

Jeremy
