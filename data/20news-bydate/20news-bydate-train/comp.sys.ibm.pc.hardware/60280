I am using a 8507 IBM monitor (19" greysale) with a Trident (1MB) card.

The screen looks great (Windows) at 640x480 but total shit at 1024x768.
There are lots of lines and the image is sorta blurry.

Is there anything I can do.  Do you think it is the monitor?  I know
that it is Interlaced at that res but still.

thanks for the help
