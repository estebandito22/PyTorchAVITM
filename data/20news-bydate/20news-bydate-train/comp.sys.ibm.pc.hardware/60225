	Just wanted to ask a question. I bought a hard disk drive second-hand
the other day, and I opened the packaging up and saw that there was a small
sticker on the drive that had a little red apple with a bite taken out of it.
It's socket did not look the same as my existing hard disk that is in my
computer already (it has fifty little pins sticking out from it instead of
the 39 that is sticking out of my old hard disk.
I don't know if disk drives for the Apple (or Mac) are different from ones
used in AT clones, so could someone tell me if I could use this hard disk
on my AT clone? If not, what did I just purchase? It's a Quantum Prodrive.
It's dated 1988 on the green board. Will I need a controller/add-in card?
All the help is much appreciated. Thanks! :)
