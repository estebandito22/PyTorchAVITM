I have a Sony 1604S 17" monitor and I don't see any lines across
the screen and am only using the non interlaced mode.
But because of the hor. lines and poping that I do see and hear
when I am usinf 800x600x256 and 1024x768x256 modes and switch back
to anything of less. I would not buy another Sony at what ever price.
Oh ya this is I guess a 15" viewing area. It don't impress me one bit!   Sam
