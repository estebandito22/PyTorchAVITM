Sorry if this has been beaten to death on this forum.

I am looking seriously at buying a 486 DX / 33 from Gateway.
I will probably buy it without a monitor, as I've heard negative
stuff about Gateway monitors.

I've also heard its tough to get through to technical
support.

I'm seeking opinions on whether or not its wise to go ahead
based on criteria such as price, warranty service, general
ruggedness of the system, reliability of the machine and of
Gateway too, and so on.

Please advise!!

Thanks in advance!
