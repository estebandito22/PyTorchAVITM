well people, I can only recomend the non-flat-screen, no-hype, 
no-nonsense NEC 3DS that I have, and PLUS, it has the ADVANTAGE of
NOT having one of those new flat screen tubes which are oversensitive
and fragile and break often!
this is a 15'' heavy-duty rugged set for those who insist on well-proven
reliable technologies!
