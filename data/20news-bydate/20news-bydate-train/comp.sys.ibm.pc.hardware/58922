Anonymous,

I saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX-50 and a 80486DX2-50.
I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's
external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be
made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing,
but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that
faster... 
I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times 
as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!

regards, JV
