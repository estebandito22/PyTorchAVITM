Being a big fan of the official IBM keyboards, I have a PS/2 keyboard attached 
to my clone computer.  I want to know if there is a software utility
out there that can be used to switch the locations of the ctrl and
cap locks keys.  Even better, does IBM or any third party make ctrl
and cap lock key replacements that can be used to visually switch
the keys as well?
