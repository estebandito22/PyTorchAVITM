Subject: Rockwell Chipset for 14.4's ... Any good?

I have a quick question regarding the Rockwell Chipset
that's`come out relatively recently--It supports v.32, v.32bis,
v.42, Group III Fax, and so on...  However, I heard there
are bugs in the chipset.  I know someone that has a ZOOM
14.4 Modem that uses the chipset, and he hasn't had a problem.

What's the word on the chipset?  Is this a ROM bug specific 
to a specific brand using the Rockwell, or is it the Rockwell
chipset itself?  And, if it is the Rockwell chipset, what 
are the chances that if I buy one of these modems (using the
Rockwell chipset), that a) the bug will affect me, b) a ROM
change will fix/compensate for the bug?

Please send responses via email...
