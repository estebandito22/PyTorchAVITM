Hi,
VLB is defined for 3 cards by 33MHz
and 2 cards by 40MHz

there are designs with 50MHz and 2 VLB-Slots.
(s. C't 9.92, 10.92, 11.92)

50MHz and 2 Slots are realy difficult to design.

Better OSs (OS/2 & iX) are able to handle more than 16MB of DRAM,
if you use EISA-Bus.
Has someone experience with VLB ??
I think of SCSI-VLB-Busmaster. The problem is the 16bit Floppy DMA
controller, which is unable to reach more than 16MB.
