While playing around with my Gateway 2000 local-bus machine last
night, it became apparent that Windows 3.1 didn't give the option
for 32-bit access for virtual memory.

I am using a permanent swap file, and the disk drive is on the local
bus interface.

Is this expected, or should I be investigating further why no 32-bit
option appears?

Thanks for any help.
