This may be a dumb question, but I need to put a hard drive on my father's
PC/XT, either MFM, RLL, or IDE. I know how to hook it up, but how do I tell
the computer the geometry of the drive. On my 386, you set it in the BIOS, but
I doubt that's how it's done on an XT. I thought it might be software with
the controller card, but the IDE card for XT's that I saw didn't come with
any. Also, how do I low level format it once it's on the computer? (Assuming
a drive which needs formatting)

advTHANKSance,
