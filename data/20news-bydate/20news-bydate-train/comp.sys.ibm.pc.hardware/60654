I have a Gateway 4DX-33V with my 3.5 inch floppy as drive A.  I
accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular
box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up, rather than getting
the "Non-system diskette" message, the machine hangs and the CMOS
gets overwritten (luckily, Gateway sends a print of the standard
CMOS settings with their systems).  This only happens with a box
of pre-formatted Fuji disks that I have, no other disks cause this
problem.  If I re-format one of the Fuji disks, the problem goes away.
I did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing.

Anyone have any idea what is going on here?  Hardware problem?  A
virus that can't be detected?  The system reading in garbage from
the boot sector?
