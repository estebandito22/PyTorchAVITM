I heard the rumor as well, but the story differed.  Intel was not coming 
out with the tripling clock 486, a clone from IBM was.  I got this rumor 
from a pretty good source ( Has designs computer equipment, and hav never 
been wrong let, but there is a first time for everything. )

...  I can just hear that rumor-mill turning now ...
