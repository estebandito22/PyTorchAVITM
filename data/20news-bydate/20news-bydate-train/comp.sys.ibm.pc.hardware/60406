I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave, as
I have just upgraded my machine with a 200Mb IDE ( And custom Controller
Mdl CI-1010 Extended IDE Controller ) While maintaining my RLL'd Wren as
master Drive.  The trick is the controller which supports up to 4 IDE Drives
while coexisting with existing Controllers ( MFM,RLL,ESDI,SCSI ).

So according to the Documentation it should work with ESDI, and I can assure
you it works with RLL.
