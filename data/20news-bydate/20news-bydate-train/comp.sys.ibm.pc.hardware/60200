Subject: Help with 24bit mode for ATI
Organization: Data General Corporation, Westboro, MA
Lines: 16

I finally got the vesa driver for my ATI graphics ultra plus (2M).  However,
when I tried to use this to view under 24bit mode, I get lines on the picture.
With 16bit or below, the picture is fine.  Can someone tell me what was wrong?
Is it the card, or is it the software?

Thanks
