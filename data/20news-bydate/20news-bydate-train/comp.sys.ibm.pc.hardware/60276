Hi,

I've got a Victor PC/XT with a 20 MB harddisk in it. The controller is
a Toshiba MFM controller, with an additional 9 pins connector.

There are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. One with 9 wires
and another with 34 wires.

The controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wire
bus.

Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine, and I wondered whether
I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room
for a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus)

How can I solve my problem, any suggestions?

If you need more info, mail me, please (luttik@fwi.uva.nl).

--Bas.
