A friend of mine is cnsidering buying a new car, and is considering the
Subaru Impreza or the Nissan Altima right now.  Which of these two cars
would you recommend.  We definately want an airbag and ABS, and room for
tall people and long legs.

If you have other suggestions for cars under $13K after dealing I'd be
interested
in you opinions as well.

PLEASE send replies to sem1@postoffice.mail.cornell.edu, no tthis address.

THANKS!
Scott
