My sister has an MGB.  She has one from the last year they were produced
(1978? 1979?).  Its in very good shape.  I've been bugging her for years
about selling it.  I've said over and over that she should sell it
before the car is worthless while she maintains that the car may
actually be increasing in value as a result of its limited availability.

Which one of us is right?  Are there MGB affectionados out there who are
still willing to pay $6K to 8K for an old MG?  Are there a lot out in the 
market?
