I'm looking for a replacement radio/tape player for a 1984 
Toyota Tercel.  Standard off-the-shelf unit is fine, but 
every place I've gone to (Service Merchandise, etc.) doesn't 
have my car in its model application book.  I want to just 
take out the old radio, and slide in the new, with minimal time
spent hooking it up and adjusting the dashboard.

If you have put in a new unit in a similar car, I'd like to hear
what brand,  how easy it was to do the change, and any other 
relevant information. 

Please answer via E-mail.
Thanks,  Tom Ostrand
