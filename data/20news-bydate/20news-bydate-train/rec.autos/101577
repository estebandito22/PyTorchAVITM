It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out-
accelerate an Integra.

But, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars have
a moonroof with a sliding sunshade?  No wimpy pop-up sunroofs or power
sliding roofs that are opaque.  A moonroof that can be opened to the air,
closed to let just light in, or shaded so that nothing comes in.

You've just got to know what's important :^).
