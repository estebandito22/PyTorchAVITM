Why crawl under the car at all? I have a machine I got for my boat that 
pulls the oil out under suction through the dip stick tube. It does an
excellent job and by moving the suction tube around, you can get more 
old oil out than by using the drain plug. I think I paid $25 at E&B Marine.
The oil goes into a steel 3 gal can - wait until it cools and decant into
your favorite device. I use soft drink bottles. Easy to take them down to
the local oil recycle center.

FORZA!
