sure sounds like they got a ringer.  the 325is i drove was definitely
faster than that.  if you want to quote numbers, my AW AutoFile shows
0-60 in 7.4, 1/4 mile in 15.9.  it quotes Car and Driver's figures
of 6.9 and 15.3.  oh, BTW, these numbers are for the 325i.

i don't know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affects it.
but don't take my word for it.  go drive it.
