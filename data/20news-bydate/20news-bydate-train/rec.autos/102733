recently-manufactured locomotives have wheel-slip detection systems
that use frequencies shared with police radar (i forget which band).
these will set off your radar detector if you get close enough, though
i believe the range is pretty short.

BTW, railroad police sometimes use radar to check for speeding trains
(just like regular police check for speeding cars), although the
intent here is for safety, not revenue collection (unlike with cars).
