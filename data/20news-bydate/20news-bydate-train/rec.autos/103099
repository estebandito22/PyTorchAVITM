   Hi everybody,

   I will buy a Honda Civic EX Coupe.  The dealer ask $12,750 for it,
including A/C ( installed ), but not including stereo, tax, registration
fees.  I live in Mexico, so I don't have time to go to a lot of dealers
and compare their prices.  The dealer is in McAllen, Tx.  Is this a good
price for that car ?  If not, how much should I pay for it ?

   Please e-mail ASAP if you don't want to post.  Thanks a lot.
