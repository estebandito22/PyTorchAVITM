   I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New
Car Guide.  What I found was a car would be given a 'Recommended'
under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a
driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed
in a front end collision.  The most highly recommended small
car (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small
cars listed.  There were many such cases of 'great' vehicles
where you wouldn't survive an accident.  Is it only me, or is
safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?
