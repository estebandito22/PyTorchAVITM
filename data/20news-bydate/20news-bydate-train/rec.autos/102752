Yes, but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot.

all they have to do is reach underneath, turn a valve, and forget the trip

But there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them.

I personally recommend, installing a 'special' locking drain plug to keep
vandals away. :---)
