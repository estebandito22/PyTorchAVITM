Mercedes-Benz announced yesterday its plans to begin building sport-utility
vehicles in the US by 1997.  They are targeted at the Jeep Grand Cherokee
et al. and will reportedly sell for less than $30,000.

Did anyone see a picture?   Is it the G-wagon (Gelaendewagen) currently
available in Europe (and in the US by grey-market) or is it an entirely new
vehicle?  Any details would be appreciated.
