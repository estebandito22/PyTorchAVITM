   Hear, hear!  Thanks, Robbie.

   You also don't read that much about violence *against* teenagers, such as
   George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi 17-year-olds,
   who were trying to surrender, with bulldozers.


I didn't know George Bush could drive a bulldozer.



Kee-ripe.
