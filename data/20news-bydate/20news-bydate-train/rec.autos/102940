GM, at least, is heading in that direction.  One of the post-sale
questions they asked me was if I'd like the choice of a cigarette
liter or an accessory plug, and another whether I'd like the choice of
an ashtray or a cup holder.

The '93 Geo Storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option
(which did not exist in the '92 I bought) -- I'm not sure about the
ash tray vs cup holder.  It's a step in the right direction.

The ashtray does make a convenient change-holder so it's not
completely useless.
