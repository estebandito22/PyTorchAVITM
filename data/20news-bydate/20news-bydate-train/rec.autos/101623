  Any truth to the rumor of an AWD 3-series for '94?  I believe
this info was published in either Popular Science or AutoWeek
a couple of months ago.

  Also, a friend told me that BMW used to make an AWD 325 called
the 325ix.  I'd appreciate any info about this car too.  Thanks..

  Thanks.

  Tim
