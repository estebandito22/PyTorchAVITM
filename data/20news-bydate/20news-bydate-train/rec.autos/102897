  Hi.. Me and My roomate are going to redecorate the "living room" and 
we thought it would be a cool idea to have a license plate from every 
state in the US and then from whereever else we could find, like canada,
Mexixo, even some European ones.

  If anyone has any ideas or knows someone that could help us out
please let me know....  The more recent, the better, but anything
would be nice.

  Either that or if you have an old plate hanging around... (hint hint!)
