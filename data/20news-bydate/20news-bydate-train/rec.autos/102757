xAssuming you don't have a Russian car with opposite threads, then

 This reminds me of the first time my cousin did an oil change on his
car. He crawled under, removed a bolt, drained the fluid, replaced the
bolt, then carefully poured in 5 quarts of oil. Didn't bother to
check the dip stick, just drove off. Didn't get too far till me found
out that he'd drained the 4-speed trans and dumped an extra 5 quarts
into the engine.:( MORAL: As Craig said don't be ashamed to get some
*in person* help the first time.
