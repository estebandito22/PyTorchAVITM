	Exterior in good condition

	Pioneer DX 680 car stereo.
		- CD player
		- 18 FM presets, 6 AM
		- removable faceplate
		- seperate component speakers professionally mounted
		  in the doors.

The car has been well maintained.  I wax it often and keep the interior
clean.  Its a good running car with a solid body (no rust thru, tiny
spots of surface rust.  When I see a spot I touch it up.)  The stereo
makes the car.  I have had no mechanical problems with it.

I'm looking for $900.00 firm.  The car has an average wholesale value of 
about $900.00 without the stereo.  The stereo cost me $500.00 last July.
