        I was whatching The History Of The Indy 500 the other day,
and early in the film, around the '10-'20's, a name, Lois Chevrolet,
came out of the blue. I wanted to know if he is THE Chevrolet founder
or mearly a driver who's name was called the same as the other guy's?:^)

                                                KONI.
