Well, I'm afraid the time has come; my rice-burner has finally died.
I'd always promised my wife that we would do a Scandanavian tour when
my car died and pick up a Volvo in Sweden, drive it around and then
import it home. 

Can anyone give me 1) advice on feasibility and relative costs 2)
references where I might learn more 3) Personal experience?

Please email

Thanks
