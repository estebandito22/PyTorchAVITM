Society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams! The basic reason
is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is
"No Big Deal". Kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on TV, we can abort 
children on demand, and kill the sick and old at will. So why be surprised
when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people. They don't care because the
message they hear is "Life is Cheap"!
