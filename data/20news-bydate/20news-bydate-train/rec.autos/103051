I heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than
gas engines because the emit less of: Carbon Monoxide,
Hydrocarbons, and Oxides of Nitrogen.  (CO, HC, NOX).

But they can put out a lot of particulate matter.  I heard
something about legislation being discussed to "clean up
diesel emissions".  Is there anything in the works to
install "scrubbers" for diesels?  How about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars?  Would it be any
different than a catylitic converter?  I'd assume easier,
since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
gasses.  Let's hear people's opinions...
