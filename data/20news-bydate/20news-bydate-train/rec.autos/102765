Unfortunately, I've got another story to add to this.  My girlfriend
and I were driving through west L.A., and got pelted by a rock just as
we were pulling away from a stoplight.  The scary thing was that the
rock was heavy enough to put a decent-sized dent in the door of my '72
Riviera which is pretty much solid "Detriot Iron."  Couple of inches
higher and it would have gone through the window.
