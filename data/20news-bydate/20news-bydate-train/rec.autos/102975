Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's 89 Ford Probe.  Every
once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
under the plywood/carpet cover on the trunk.  I would guess this usually happens
after a good thunder storm.  A few Qs:

1) Is this a common problem?
2) Where are the drain holes located for the hatch?

Thanks for any info.
Tom
