I have the EuroWiper boots in White and had to throw away the first pair
since I found no way of cleaning them after they looked almost black. Now
I have my second pair of white ones and once again they are dirty. I need
a way to clean them w/o removing them since I had to cut them to remove
them, is there a way? Or should I just buy black ones? 
thanks
-Joel
