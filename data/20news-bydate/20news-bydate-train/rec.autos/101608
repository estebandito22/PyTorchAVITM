I bought a car with a defunct engine, to use for parts
for my old but still running version of the same car.

The car I bought has good tires.

Is there anything in particular that I should do to
store the defunct car long-term?  I'd hate to have
parts of it go bad.  Someone has told me it's bad
for the tires to not move the car once-in-a-while.
Is this true?   Do I need some props to take the
weight of the tires?

Best to reply by mail, I am getting spotty news delivery.
