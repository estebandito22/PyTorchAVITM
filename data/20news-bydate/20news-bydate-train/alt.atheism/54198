You were a liberal arts major, weren'tcha?

Guess you never saw that photo of the smallest logo in the world--
"IBM" made with noble gas atoms (krypton? xenon? I forget the

Men who love brown tend to be warm and deep, sensitive to the needs and

the fire, walking in the rain or catching snowflakes on their tongue is
a real turn-on to a lover of brown. (thanx becka!)
