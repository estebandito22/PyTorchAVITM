When someone says:

	"So after 1000 years of sightseeing and roaming around its 
	ok to come back, kill Palastinians, and get their land back, 
	right?"

Yes, that's casual antisemitism.    I can think of plenty of ways
to criticize Israeli policy without insulting Jews or Jewish history.

Can't you?
