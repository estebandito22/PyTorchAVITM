First, I am not a doctor.  I know about this because I have been
through it.

It sounds like tonsilitis (lit. swollen tonsils).  Feel under your jaw
hinge for a swelling on each side.  If you find them, its tonsilitis.
I've had this a couple of times in the past.  The doctor prescribed a
weeks course of penicillin and that cleared it up.

In my case it was associated with glandular fever, which is a viral
infection which (from my point of view) resembled flu and tonsilitis
that kept coming back for a year or so.  There is a blood test for
this.

In conclusion, see a doctor (if you have not done so already).

Paul.
