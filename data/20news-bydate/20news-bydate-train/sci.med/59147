	Then let me ask you for a "workable" solution.  We have a name
here that implies certain things to many people.  Rather than trying
to educate each and every person that comes to the group -- is there
some "name" that would imply what this group was originally
intended for?  

	My dad was a lawyer -- as such I grew up with being a stickler
for "meaning".  In my "reality", psychoactives *technically* could 
range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more
standard recreational drugs.  In practice I had hoped to see it
limited to those that were above some psychoactive level -- like
some of the drugs you mention, but also possibly including *some*
recreational drugs -- but with conversation limited to their psychoactive 
effects -- the recent query about "bong water", I thought was a bit
off topic -- so I just hit "k".

	But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution --
what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to
discuss?  It sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs, or something
similar -- I don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to
describe alot of those drugs.  There is a big difference between a
drug that if taken in "certain doses, over a period of days may have
a psychoactive effect in some people", vs. many of the drugs in
PIHKAH which *are* psychoactive.
