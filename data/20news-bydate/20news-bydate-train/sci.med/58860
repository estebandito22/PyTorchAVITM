	Two thoughts.

	- I think that psychologically it will be easier for the next 
generation to accept genetic manipulation.  It seems that people frown
upon 'messing with Nature', ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that.
Any new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris' and manipulation
we routinely do is 'natural' and certainly 'not a big deal'.

	- Most interesting human traits will probably be massively
polygenetic and be full of trade-offs.  In addition, without a positive
social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts, having them won't
be the advantage it's made out to be.  Some people will certainly pursue it
as if it is the Grail, but we know how most of those quests turn out.
