I don't think that's a problem.  My face is quite oily too.  I had a moderate
acne problem for many years.  I then found that if I vigorously scrub my face
with a nail brush and soap (Irish Spring) twice a day the acne was not a 
problem.  I can still leave a pretty health nose print on a mirror after 45 min
(don't ask ;->) but acne is not a real problem anymore.
