Perhaps.  Now, just what leads you to believe that it was MSG and not some
other ingredient in the food that made you ill?

=These people aren't condemning Chinese food, Mr. Chen - just one of its

And you're condemning one particular ingredient without any evidence that
that's the ingredient to which you reacted.

understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level (or below).  So
unless what I'm saying is directly related to VAX/VMS, don't hold me or my
organization responsible for it.  If it IS related to VAX/VMS, you can try to
hold me responsible for it, but my organization had nothing to do with it.
