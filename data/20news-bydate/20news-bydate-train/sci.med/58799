Nothing unisual.

Chinese Restaurant Syndrome (CRS):
a transient syndrome, associated with arterial dilatation, due to ingestion
of monosodium glutamate, which is used liberally in seasoning chinese
food; it is characterized by throbbing of the head, lightheadedness,
tightness of the jaw, neck and shoulders, and bachache.

This was known long ago.  Brain produces and uses some MSG naturally,
but not in doses it is served at some chinese places. 
Having said that, i might add, that in MHO, MSG does not enhance
flavor enoughf for me to miss it.  When I go to chinese places,
I order food without MSG.  Goos places will do it for you.
A prerequisite for such a service would be a waiter, capable of
understanding, what you want.


Good Luck.
