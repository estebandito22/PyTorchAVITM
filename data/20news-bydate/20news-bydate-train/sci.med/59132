Hello,

I am writing a grant proposal for a Developmental Genetics class and I
have chose to look at the Neurofibromatosis 1 gene and its variable
expressivity.  I am curious what has already been done on this subject,
especially the relationship between specific mutations and the resulting
phenotype.  My literature search has produce many references, but I want to
make sure I am proposing new research.  If anyone knows aything that has been
recently or key peopl doing research to search for using MEDLINE, I would
apprciate being informed.

Thank you.
