     If the nose culture shows Staph, then Ceftin or even Ceclor
     are better. Suprax does not kill Staph. Treating bacterial
     infections involves a lot of try-and-fail because the
     infections often involve multiple organisms with many resistant
     strains. Some 60% of Hemophilus Influenza strains are now
     resistant. What works for me and my organisms may not work
     for you and yours. Keep experimenting.
