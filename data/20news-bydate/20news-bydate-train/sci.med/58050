Larry:

The subject content IS serious; as is the question.

On one hand you state that "things have changed dramatically" but, at the
same time nothing you "can think of has changed".  Your girlfriend seems
to want to see a counselor, but you don't.  

I'd recommend that you examine your hesitation to see a counselor.  It's
a very good environment to examine issues.  

The fact of the matter is:  your girlfriend has a different perception than
you.  The TWO of you need to address the issue in order to resolve it.

Please consider going to a counselor with your girlfriend.  What could it
possibly hurt?
