I'm sure the Pittsburgh group has published the baboon work, but I
don't know where.  In Chicago they were doing lobe transplants from
living donors, and I'm sure they've published.  I don't read the
transplant literature.  I just see the liver transplant patients
when they get into neurologic trouble (pretty frequent), so that
and the newspapers and scuttlebutt is the way I keep up with what
they are doing.  Howard Doyle works with them, and can tell you more.
