I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity
which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring
from the diet.  The theory -- which was backed up by interesting anecdotal
results -- is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these
chemicals than other people.  I don't remember any connection being made
with seizures, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an all-natural diet.
