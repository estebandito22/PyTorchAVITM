My husband woke up three days ago with a small sore spot
(a spot about the size of a nickel) on one of his testicles. Bottom side,
no knots or lumps, just a little sore spot.  He says it reminds him of 
how a bruise feels.  He has no recollection of hitting it or anything like
that that would cause a bruise. (He asssures me he'd remember something
like that :-) 

Any clues as to what it might be?  He's somewhat of a hypochondriac (sp?)
so he's sure he's gonna die. . .

Thanks!!
