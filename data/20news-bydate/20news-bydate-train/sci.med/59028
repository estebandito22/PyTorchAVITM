MSG is common in many food we eat, including Chinese (though some oriental
restaurants might put a tad too much in them).  I've noticed that when I
go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get
a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to many
of my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the
time at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)

So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that
MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.

Stick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly
harms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?  Taste food as it should
be tasted, and don't cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG.
