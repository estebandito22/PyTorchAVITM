Since her symptoms are only pain she would do weel to seek the
advice of a good, multi-disciplinary pain clinic. It is distressing
to think that people are stll being told they have to "live with the
pain" when many options for pain management (rather than treating
MRI findings) are available. A good pain clinic will accept that
this lady's problem is her pain and set about finding ways of
