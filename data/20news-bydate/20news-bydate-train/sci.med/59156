A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohn's
disease.

But she can't seem to eat certain foods, such as fresh vegetables,
without discomfort, and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence.

Her question is: are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
problems of people with Crohn's disease ?

(I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric).

Thanks in advance,
