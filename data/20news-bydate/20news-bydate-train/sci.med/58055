Ron, you're an endless source of misinformation!  There ARE no sacral
vertebrae.  There is a bone called the sacrum at the end of the spine.
It is a single, solid bone except in a few patients who have a
lumbarized S1 as a normal variant.  How do you adjust a solid bone,
break it?  No, don't tell me, I don't want to know.
