Blood glucose levels of 40 or so are common several hours after a
big meal.  This level will usually not cause symptoms.

If you mean "reactive" hypoglycemia, there are usually no symptoms,

faintness, sweating, palpitations, etc. reliably several hours after
a big meal, the recommendations are obvious - eat smaller meals.
