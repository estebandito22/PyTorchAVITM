The people in charge already know what kind of 'care' they are 
providing, and they don't give a rat's ass about your repeat business.

You are much more likely to do some good writing to local newspapers,
and broadcast news shows.  If you do, keep the letter short and to the point
so they don't discard it out of hand, and emphasize exactly what you
are upset about.

It's possible that the local health department can help you complain to 
someone official, but really, that 'clinic' exists for the sole purpose 
of generating walk-in income through advertising, and *nothing* you can do 
will change them -- all you can hope for is to help someone else avoid them.

I'm glad it sounds like your son did ok, anyway.

My opinion only, of course,
Steve
