What does a lack of taste of foods, or a sense of taste that seems "off"
when eating foods in someone who has cancer mean? What are the possible
causes of this? Why does it happen?

Pt has Stage II breast cancer, and is taking tamoxifin. Also has Stage IV
lung cancer with known CNA metastasis, and is taking klonopin (also had
cranial radiation treatments).

Thanks!
