There turned out to be a very simple, conventional explanation for the
phenomenon.  I can't recall the details, but I believe it had to do with
the object between the plates altering the field because of purely
mechanical properties like capacitance.  The "aura" was caused by direct
exposure of the film from variations in field strength.
