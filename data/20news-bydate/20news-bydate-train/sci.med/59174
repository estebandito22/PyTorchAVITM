Here is the tollfree hotline for the Epilepsy Foundation
of America - 1-800-EFA-1000.  They will be able to answer
your questions and send you information and references on
seizure types, medication, etc.  They can also give you references
for a pediatric neorologist in your area.  Also ask for the 
number of your local Foundation who can put you in touch with
a Parent Support Group and social workers.
Good Luck.
