I have between 15 and 25 nosebleeds each week, as a result of a genetic
predisposition to weak capillary walls (Osler-Weber-Rendu). Fortunately,
each nosebleed is of short duration.

Does anyone know of any method to reduce this frequency? My younger brothers
each tried a skin transplant (thigh to nose lining), but their nosebleeds
soon returned. I've seen a reference to an herb called Rutin that is
supposed to help, and I'd like to hear of experiences with it, or other
techniques.
