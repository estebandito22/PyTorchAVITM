     I am doing a term paper on steroids, actually the scientist who
helped crate the drug. I discovered that Joseph Fruton is one of the
researchers who helped create anabolic steroids. The only information on 
this person I know is he was a biochemist that did research in the 1930's.
I already did research at my local libraries, but I still need more
information. My instructor is requiring resources from the computer
networks. Please write back concerning my subject, any books, articles,
etc., will be appreciated.
