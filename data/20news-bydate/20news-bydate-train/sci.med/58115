Two approaches that I've used: Tofranil, 50 mg qhs, Naproxen 250mg bid.
The Naproxen doesn't seem to be as bad as things like Tylenol in promoting
the analgesic abuse Headache.  DHE IV infusions for about 3 days (in
hospital).  Cold turkey is the only way I think.  Tapering doesn't
help. I wouldn't know how you can do this without your doctor.  I haven't
seen anyone successfully do it alone.  Doesn't mean it can't be done.
