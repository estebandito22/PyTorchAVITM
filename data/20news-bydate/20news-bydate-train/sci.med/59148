Isn't this what HIV is about - the "normal immune response" to an exposure?

I had electrical pulse nerve testing done a while back.  The needles were taken
from a dirty drawer in an instrument cart and were most certainly NOT
sterile or even clean for that matter.  More than likely they were fresh
from the previous patient.  I WAS concerned, but I kept my mouth shut.  I
probably should have raised hell!

Any comments?  No excuses.
