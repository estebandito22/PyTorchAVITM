Sumatriptan(Imitrex) just became available in the US in a subcutaneous
injectable form.  Is there an oral form available in CA?  A friend(yes
really not me!)  has severe migranes about 2-3 times per week.  We
live right by the CA border and he has gotten drugs for GERD prescribed
by a US physician and filled in a CA pharmacy, but not yet FDA approved
in the US.  What would be the cost of the oral form in CA$ also if
anyone would have that info?    

Thanks
