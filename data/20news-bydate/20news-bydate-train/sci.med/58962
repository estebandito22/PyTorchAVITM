I know that there is MSG sensitivity.  When I eat foods with MSG I get
very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. I first
experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese
food almost everyday for lunch.  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all.  I can
notice immediately when I have eaten any.  I try to avoid MSG completely.

Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing
the exact same rash on their hands.  I couldn't understand why because I
don't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I still
love it).  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where
one of their favorite foods.  One of the main ingredients in the flavor
packets is MSG.  Now I look at all labels.  You would be surprised at
places you find MSG.
