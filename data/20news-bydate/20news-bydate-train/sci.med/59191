   Isn't there a relatively new treatment for kidney stones involving
   a non-invasive use of ultra-sound where the patient is lowered
   into some sort of liquid when he/she undergoes treatment? I'm sure
   I've read about it somewhere. If I remember it correctly it is a
   painless and effective treatment.

   saw big signs showing the way to the "Kidney stone chrusher" ...
