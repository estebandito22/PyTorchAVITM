Having had limited tinea pedis for more than 30 years, and finding
it resistant to ALL creams and powders I have tried, I wonder why
dermatologists do not use lasers to destroy the fungus. It would
seem likely to be effective and inexpensive. Are there good reasons
for not using lasers?
I was told that dermatology had not yet reached the laser age.
