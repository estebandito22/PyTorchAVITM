The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain
is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in
both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other
therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol
work better in migraine than tension-type headache.

The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got
relief.  Also, please understand that a diagnosis other than
migraine does not necessarily mean "psychogenic"; I suspect that
organic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in
migraine.
