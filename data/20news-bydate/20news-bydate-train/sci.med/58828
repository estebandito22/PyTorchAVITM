Yeah, it might, if you only read the part you quoted.  You somehow left 
out the part about "we all ate the same thing."  Changes things a bit, eh?

You complain that people blame MSG automatically, since it's an unknown and
therefore must be the cause.  It is equally (if not more) unreasonable to
defend it, automatically assuming that it CAN'T be the culprit.

Pepper makes me sneeze.  If it doesn't affect you the same way, fine.
Just don't tell me I'm wrong for saying so.

These people aren't condemning Chinese food, Mr. Chen - just one of its 
(optional) ingredients.  Try not to take it so personally.
