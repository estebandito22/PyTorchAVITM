Melissa, there is a simpler procedure called a "Dorsal slit" that is
really the first step of the usual circumcision.  It is simpler and
quicker, but the pain is about the same as circumcision after the
anesthetic wears off and the aesthetic result post healing is not as
good.  See your friendly urologist for more details.
