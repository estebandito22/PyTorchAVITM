IMHO, the original poster has no business soliciting diagnoses off the net,
nor does Dr./Mr.  O'Donnell have any business supplying same. This is one
major reason real physicians avoid this newsgroup like the plague. It is
also another example of the double standard: if I as a physician offered
to diagnose and treat on the net, I can be sued. But people without
qualifications are free to do whatever they want and disclaim it all with
"I'm not a doctor."

Get and keep this crap off the net. Period.
