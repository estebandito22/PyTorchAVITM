Hello,

I am planning on attending Podiatry School next year.

I have narrowed my choices to the Pennsylvania College of Podiatric
Medicine, in Philadelphia, or the California College of Podiatric
Medicine in San Francisco.  

If anyone has any information or oppinions about these two schools, please
tell me.  I am having a hard time deciding which one to attend, and must
make a decision very soon.  

thank you, Larry
