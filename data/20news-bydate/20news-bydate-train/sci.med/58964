My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our
first child (due June 15th).  We interviewed a young doctor last week
and were very impressed with her.  However, I discovered that she is
actually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a "Doctor of 
Osteopathy" (D.O.).  What's the difference?  I believe the pediatrician
*I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from
any other doctor I've seen over the years.

My dictionary says that osteopathy is "a medical therapy that emphasizes
manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought
to cause disease and inhibit recovery."

Jeez, this sounds like chiropractic.  I remember getting shots and
medicine from *my* pediatrician D.O., and don't remember any 
"manipulative techniques".  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to
the real, practical difference between an M.D. and a D.O.  Also, I'm
interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who
follows one or the other medical philosophy.

Readers of sci.med:  Please respond directly to sbrenner@attmail.com;
I do not read this group regularly and probably won't see your response
if you just post it here.  Sorry for the cross-posting, but I'm hoping
there's some expertise here.
