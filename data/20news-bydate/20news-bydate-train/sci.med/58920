Essential tremor is a progressive hereditary tremor that gets worse
when the patient tries to use the effected member.  All limbs, vocal
cords, and head can be involved.  Inderal is a beta-blocker and
is usually effective in diminishing the tremor.  Alcohol and mysoline
are also effective, but alcohol is too toxic to use as a treatment.
