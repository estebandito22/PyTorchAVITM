Indeed. I spend about 60% of my time dealing with quality stuff. It
is a hot number. 
Two journals worth looking at are:-
Quality Review Bulletin. Pub:Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations, one Renaissance boulevard, Oakbrook
Terrace, IL 60181
Quality in Health Care. BMJ Publishing Group, Box No. 560B,
Kennebunkport, ME 04046
