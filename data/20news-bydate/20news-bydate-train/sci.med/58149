 | You certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such.

 | That's not the idea, and no, they don't work.

	I *believe* there is a known synergism between certain
analgesics and caffiene.  For treating pain, not inflammation.

	Now that I am an ibuprofen convert I haven't taken it for some
time, but excedrin really works! (grin)
