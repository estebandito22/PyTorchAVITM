Of course, bee venom isn't a single chemical.  Could be your brother is
reacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shock
in other people.

Similarly, Chinese food isn't just MSG.  There are a lot of other ingredients
in it.  Why, when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they don't
normally consume, one of which happens to be MSG, do they immediately conclude
that any negative reaction is to the MSG?

=I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad

I'd be surprised if some of these reactions weren't due to other ingredients.

unless what I'm saying is directly related to VAX/VMS, don't hold me or my

hold me responsible for it, but my organization had nothing to do with it.
