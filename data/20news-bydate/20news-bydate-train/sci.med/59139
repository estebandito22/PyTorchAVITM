Summary: Fast dynamics of cytoskeleton re: transformed cells?
Keywords: cytoskeleton, microtubule, tubulin

I'm looking for good background and review paper references that can help me
understand the dynamics of cytoskeleton in normal and transformed cells.  In
particular, I'm not interested in translational behavior and cell motility,
but rather in the internal motions of the cytoskeleton and its components
under normal and transformed circumstances.

Also, I'd appreciate any data on force constants, mechanical, and elastic
properties of microtubules, and viscous properties of cytoplasm.  Any other
info relevant to the vibrational or acoustical properties of these would
be useful to me.

Thanks...
