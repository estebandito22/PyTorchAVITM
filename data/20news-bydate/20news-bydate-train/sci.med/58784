The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so
greatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some
claim their heart "skipped" beats once in a while. Some reacted with
headache, some stomach ache. Some had watery eyes or running nose, some
had itchy skin or rashes. More serious accusations include respiration 
difficulty and brain damage. 

Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food poisoning. But
if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.
