I have a friend who has just been diagnosed with Lupus, and I know nothing
about this disease. The only thing I do know is that this is some sort of
skin disease, and my friend shows no skin rashes - in fact, they used a 
blood test to determine what had been wrong with an on going sacro-
illiac joint problem. 
I am finding a hard time finding information on this disease. Could
anyone please enlighten me as to the particulars of this disease. 
please feel free to E-mail me at

Thanks in advance.
